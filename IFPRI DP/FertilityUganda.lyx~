\begin_layout Title
Fertility, Agricultural labour Supply and Production - Instrumental Variable
 Evidence from Uganda
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Fertility is likely to affect agricultural production through its effect
 on the supply of agricultural labour.
 Using the fact that in traditional, patriarchal societies sons are often
 preferred to girls, we isolate exogenous variation in the number of children
 born to the mother and relate it to agricultural labour supply and production
 outcomes in Uganda, a country that combines a dominant agricultural sector
 with one of the highest fertility rates in the world.
 We find that fertility has a seizable negative effect on household labour
 allocation to subsitence agriculture.
 Households with lower fertility devote significantly more time to land
 preparation and weeding, while larger households grow less matooke and
 sweet potatoes.
 We find no significant effect on agricultural productivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the most basic level, subsistence farmers in rural Africa combine natural
 with human resources to make a living.
 They use mainly household labour on their own small plots to produce for
 own consumption.
 As such, the quantity of family labour available for agriculture is an
 important determinant of well-being.
 More children means mothers, and to a lesser extend fathers, will need
 to spend more time on reproductive chores, meaning less time will be available
 to spend on agricultural activities.
 Since women are known to supply most of the agricultural labour the loss
 in time needed for reproductive activities may hurt subsistence households
 disproportionately.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Uganda has one of the highest fertility rates in the world and a substantial
 part of the population lives in rural areas making a living out of semi-subsist
ence agriculture.
 Even in the context of large reductions in child mortality rates, total
 fertility rates remain stubbornly high.
 On average, Ugandan women in rural areas bear 6.8 children over the course
 of their reproductive lives

.
 The question on how fertility affects well-being through its effect on
 household labour supply and agricultural production is therefore relevant.
 For example, knowledge on how fertility affects time allocation by different
 categories within the household is important to gender-stream efforts related
 to crop intensification and commercialization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we will investigate the effect of fertility on agricultural
 production at the household level.
 In particular, we will investigate the effect of the number of biological
 children on household member labour input in agriculture (further categorized
 in land preparation, weeding, input application and harvesting).
 We will also look at the effect of fertility on crop portfolio, area cultivated
, production and productivity for the five most important crops.
 However, fertility is a choice variable to agricultural households.
 For instance, mothers who work long hours in the field may try to avoid
 becoming pregnant because this would only increase hardship.
 If fertility, agricultural labour allocation and agricultural production
 is jointly determined, just looking at correlations will be misleading,
 and one needs to find a way to separate the exogenous variation from the
 part that is jointly determined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our identification strategy is a simple but powerful quasi-experimental
 approach inspired by the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:aea:aecrev:v:88:y:1998:i:3:p:450-77"

\end_inset

.
 We use the fact that, in conservative, patriarchal societies such as Uganda,
 male off-springs are generally preferred to female children.
 This preference and the random nature of the sex of a newborn gives rise
 to particular fertility patterns.
 For example, households that have a girl as the first-born are likely to
 have more children 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Jayachandran01082011"

\end_inset

.
 In other words, we use the sex of off-springs as an instrumental variable
 (IV) to determine the exogenous component of fertility at the household
 level.
 Such a Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS) approach is expected to yield consistent
 estimates for the causal effect of fertility on agricultural labour supply
 and associated agricultural production within the household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is an active debate among scholars in the field of labour economists
 on the relationship between fertility and labour supply.

 use the fact that American couples prefer children of different sex, and
 and are likely to keep trying if the first two children are of the same
 sex as a source of exogenous variation.
 We will argue that in a developing country context, the sex of the (first
 born) child makes more sense as an instrument.
 Indeed, this instrumentation strategy has been used in such a context.

 use the sex of the first two children to predict exogenous variation in
 fertility in India and its effect on well-being.
 We feel it is too ambitious to relate fertility directly to poverty and
 related measures of consumption, as the sex of the first two children may
 directly affect consumption, violating the exclusion restriction.
 We restrict ourselves to agricultural labour allocation of adult household
 members, area planted and production.
 In addition, most studies that look at the effects of fertility on labour
 allocation in a developing country context use data from Asian countries.
 The high incidence of selective abortion in these areas may mean the sex
 of the first child or children becomes endogenous as well.
 This is likely to be much less of a problem in our application, which is
 to our knowledge the first such application to an African country.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the sex of the first-born, the sex of the first two children
 born, as well as the percentage of girls as a share of total number of
 children all significantly explain observed fertility, measured as the
 gap between actual children born and a theoretical maximal fecundity for
 each age cohort.
 Fertility has a strong negative effect on number of days worked by the
 mother in the field.
 We also find some evidence of a negative effect for the father, but the
 size of the effect is only half that of the women.
 Households with lower fertility devote significantly more time to land
 preparation and weeding.
 We also find that smaller households grow and produce more matooke.
 This effect holds to a lesser extent for sweet potatoes.
 We find no impact on yields.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This article is organized as follows.
 The next section gives a brief overview of the most prominent papers that
 are related to our study.
 Then, we make our case for the use of the sex of the first-born as an instrumen
t using literature that documents child gender and reproductive behaviour.
 We then present the data we will use in our application, and describe our
 main variables we will use in the analysis.
 Next, we present the results.
 In this section, we first take a close look at the first stage regression.
 We then look at the effect of fertility on household labour supply, considering
 differential effects depending agricultural labour activities.
 We then turn to the effect of household size aspects of agricultural production
 and productivity.
 A final section concludes.

 focus on the consumption side effects of household size in a developing
 country context.
 They note the contradiction between widely held views that larger households
 are often poorer (due to increased competition for a given food stock)
 and scale economies in consumption.
 They find that, if economies of scale are accounted for within households,
 the negative correlation between household size and consumption expenditure
 disappears.
 On the production side of the farm household, the effect of household size
 is equally ambiguous.
 Some may argue that larger households means that more labour is available
 within the household.
 The additional advantage of this labour is that it is not subject to the
 moral hazard effects often attributed to hired labour

 But at the same time, more dependents within the household means more time
 needs to be allocated to reproductive activities.
 Also, agricultural labour and agricultural production may be subject to
 diminishing returns.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relationship between fertility and household labour supply has been
 studied most carefully in the field of labour economics.
 Since this literature is so extensive, we only mention two of the most
 influential works here.
 The first is

LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

, who attempt to quantify the effect of fertility on labour supply in the
 US.
 They deal with the endogeneity of the number of children women have by
 exploiting the fact that Americans tend to prefer mixed sibling-sex in
 their household.
 They argue that parents of same-sex siblings are significantly and substantiall
y more likely to go on to have an additional child.
 They find that more children does indeed reduce labour force participation
 of women, but the effect is less pronounced than previous studies suggested.
 They find no effect on the labour supply of the father.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another paper that tries to answer the same question is 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:ucp:jpolec:v:88:y:1980:i:2:p:328-48"

\end_inset

.
 In this paper, the exogenous variation in the number of children is obtained
 by using the occurrence of multiple births (twins) at first birth as an
 instrument.
 The authors argue that the comparison between women who gave birth to a
 single child at first birth and women who gave birth to twins at first
 birth allows one to identify the causal effect of an extra child on an
 outcome (in their case labour supply).
 Since the occurrence of twins is exogenous, there is no danger that heterogenei
ty in women preferences contaminates the estimated coefficients.
 The study finds that household size reduces female labour supply, but the
 effect is only temporary

 use sex of the first two children as a natural experiment and find that
 household size increases poverty in India.
 They use essentially the same argument as we will make in the next section.
 However, welfare, and the related concept of poverty, relies on consumption
 per capita.
 Consumption per capita as the independent variable is likely to be problematic
 in the two stage least squares setting.
 There is a real danger that the instrumental variable affects the outcome
 variable directly, instead of only through its influence on family size.
 For instance, if boys consume on average more than girls, the exclusion
 restriction is violated.
 There is also some evidence on Indonesia.

 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:iza:izadps:dp2162"

, fertility is related to the allocation of labour within households.
 However, they move away from the direct instrumental variable approach
 that is standard and instead estimate a reproduction function taking into
 account endogenous contraceptive choice.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the above studies employ data from South East Asia.
 It is well-known that fertility at birth is already skewed in many Asian
 countries.
 For instance India, from which 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 drawn their sample, is particularly known for selective abortion of girls
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "New8"

\end_inset

.
 This non-random distribution of sex of children opens the door to potential
 correlation between the instrument and the error term of the structural
 equation.
 One example would be that less educated, poorer households that depend
 heavily on agriculture engage more in the abortion of female fetuses.
 In the context of weak instruments, such correlation can seriously bias
 estimates

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we will try to address some of the above challenges.
 We will use the sex of the first-born and variations thereof as our instrumenta
l variables.
 We will relate fertility to agricultural labour supply and agricultural
 production, since there is a direct link between these three variables.
 We will also concentrate on Africa.
 Here, while there is a boy preference, reproduction rate norms are high
 and the cost of raising children is low.
 This means that selective abortion is much less of a concern.

However, at a more basic level, boy preference is already revealed by parents
 who, if asked in for example surveys, often state clearly that they prefer
 boys to girls.
 Such preferences lead to a particular decision rule with respect to fertility,
 where the likelihood that children are added to the household is positively
 correlated to the number of surviving girls in the household.
 The preference for boys over girls results in what

 There are indeed many studies that show empirically that in settings with
 characterized by son preference, a couple that just had a son is more likely

 argue that son preference leads mothers to breastfeed daughters and children
 without brothers relatively less long.
 Since breastfeeding is an effective birth control method, this observed
 behaviour also explains why couples with a son seem to wait longer before
 they have the next child.
 In addition, this underlying consequence of sex bias may partly explain
 a range of outcomes observed in the area of health, mortality and possibly
 even educational attainment.
 Their model shows that even when parents want both boys and girls to have
 the same health and education, disparities can arise passively because
 of fertility preferences.
 They show that a

 fertility rule results in girls having on average more siblings, leading
 to more competition for resources within the household.

The occurrence of boy preference is explained by various cultural and economic
 factors documented in the anthropological and demographic literature.
 In countries where no formal, risk free old age insurance (such as a pensions)
 is available, parents may choose to invest more in children that have a
 higher chance of being able to support them at old age 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "RePEc:ucp:jpolec:v:90:y:1982:i:1:p:52-73"

\end_inset

.
 Anthropological and demographic evidence emphasize the dominant role of
 males in traditional patrilineal societies where descent and inheritance
 are transmitted through the male line.
 Furthermore, male children strengthen the relationship between the wife
 and her husband's kin (by guaranteeing the continuation of his lineage)
 and secure (the mother's) access to residence and inheritance upon the
 husband's death.
 Older women have power through their sons and rule over their daughters-in-law
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The spread of primary schooling in sub-Saharan Africa has also affected
 fertility patterns 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "RePEc:bla:popdev:v:26:y:2000:i:3:p:483-515"

\end_inset

 Since boys are more likely to be sent (and kept) in school than girls,
 the extra cost associated with primary schooling will be higher in families
 with more boys.
 This, in turn, will encourage families who already have boys to reduce
 fertility.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the evidence on the existence of boy preference comes from Asian
 countries.
 There are relatively few inquiries into sex preference in Sub Saharan Africa.
 Even more, it is often assumed that gender preferences are much lower or
 even absent in Sub-Saharan Africa.
 This is surprising, as many of the cultural and economic factors that are
 observed in Asia equally apply to Africa.
 One study that documents significant gender bias in Africa is

 reduced childbearing at higher parities, in addition to the mixed-child
 preference.
 As such, we feel that the sex of the first-born (or closely related indicators)
 provide a valid instrument for fertility at the household level in Uganda.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Data and Descriptive Statistics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will use the Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS) 2005/06.
 While being somewhat dated, we have chosen this survey because it has much
 more information on agriculture than the more recent UNHS of 2009/10, or
 2012/13.
 Structured with a standard Living Standard Measurement Survey - Integrated
 Survey on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) in mind, the UNHS 2005/06 collected detailed
 information on a sample of almost 43,000 people in 7,500 households in
 Uganda.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ideally, we would like to have a sample of households where all desired
 children were born.
 The fact that we are working with a cross-section of households, where
 households are at different stages in their reproductive lives, creates
 some problems.
 Assume a couple that has just formed and is entering their reproductive
 stage.
 In our sample, such households will show up with a smaller than average
 household size.
 Now, if the first-born happens to be a girl, this may mistakenly be interpreted
 as running against our hypothesis that households where the first-born
 is a girl have higher fertility.
 On the other hand, if the first child is a boy, this may lead us to put
 too much confidence in our hypothesis, as the smaller household size is
 not only due to the fact that the first-born is a son, but also due to
 the fact that the household only just entered their reproductive stage.
 The fact that we are working with a cross section of households rather
 than historical data on all births by women that have reached the end of
 their reproductive lives is also reflected in the average number of children.
 This is only 3.13 children, while women bear almost 7 children over their
 entire reproductive period.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To deal with this problem, we work with the difference in the actual number
 of children reported and the maximum reproductive capacity for a woman
 at a certain age, rather than simply the number of children in the household
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Alternatively, one could use the number of children within the household
 and control for the age of the mother.
 We have also run the analysis using this strategy and came to virtually
 the same conclusions.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We will refer to this measure of fertility as the gap or shortfall in fertility.
 To get the latter, we would need to estimate the average age at menarche
 within the population, and then simply divide into age the pregnancy period
 plus post pregnancy lactation in-fecund period.
 In addition, one would also need to corporate the maternal mortality ratio
 for "censoring" women's lives who have too many children and thus increasing
 her mortality rate (and exit from the sample).
 Instead, we took the 95th percentile of total fertility rates per age from
 the Demographic and Health Survey of Uganda (2011).
 This is probably a good approximation of the upper bound by age of fertility
 in the population.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The selection of children is base on the household roster of the UNHS 2005/06.
 In particular, we will select individuals that are indicated as son or
 daughter of the household head.
 There is another potential problem when using a cross sectional survey
 such as the UNHS that only looks at reported dependents currently living
 within the household to calculate the difference between actual and theoretical
 fertility.
 Older women may be living in households where some of the older children
 have already left the household.
 Thus, at around the age of thirty, the gap between reported children in
 the household and theoretical fertility starts to increase more rapidly
 because of children growing old enough to start household of their own.
 More troubling, the reported gender of the oldest son or daughter living
 in the household may not be the gender of first-born.
 To overcome this problem, we restrict our sample to households where the
 mother is between 16 and 32.
 The cut off age of 32 is because at this age, the first-born of the mother
 will turn 16, which is our entry age into the sample of mothers.
 Restricting our sample in this way has a second advantage.
 For some of the indirect outcome variables we will use, such as productivity,
 one may argue that the gender of the first-born has a direct effect on
 the outcome, instead of only through fertility.
 Restricting our sample to households with only young mothers means that
 the children are also likely to be younger, and thus less likely to engage
 in agricultural production, making a violation of the exclusion restriction
 less likely.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at the sex of the first-born is only one possible strategy.
 One may argue that the sex of the first born is not very relevant in a
 context where women bear on average almost 7 children.
 Indeed, it is likely that households will get a second child irrespective
 of the sex of the first.
 This is supported by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Jayachandran01082011"

\end_inset

, who find that the difference in breastfeeding duration between boys and
 girls is largest near target family size, when gender is most predictive
 of subsequent fertility.
 Therefore, we will not only use the sex of the first-born child as an instrumen
t for fertility, but also experiment with alternative instruments such as
 an indicator that the first two children are girls or a variable that expresses
 the share of female children in the total family size.
 The next section presents some preliminary statistics that suggest how
 gender patterns in the household are related to fertility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Gender of Offspring and Fertility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we make a case for the different instruments we will use
 in the analysis.
 While we will run first stage regression in the next section, we present
 some simple descriptive statistics here to show that gender of the first
 few children, as well as the share of male children in the total number
 of children, affects fertility.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:gender-and-fertility"

\end_inset

 summarizes our findings.
 The first two columns in the top panel checks if households that have a
 daughter as first-born are more likely to have extra children.
 We simply calculated the percentage of households that had more than one
 child conditional on their first born being a son or a girl.
 In other words, we calculate the probability that a household has at least
 one additional child (prop +1).
 We find that in the sub-sample where the first child is a boy, about 37.46
 percent of households will have at least one more child.
 However, if the first child happened to be a girl, almost 40 percent of
 households will have at least one more child.
 This confirms our hypothesis that households have a higher chance of adding
 children if the firstborn is a girl.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also look at the the effect of the gender of the first-born on shortfall
 in actual fertility to theoretical fertility.
 In the first two columns in the bottom panel, we report this fertility
 gap for these two groups of households.
 We find that households that have a boy as the first-born child have an
 average fertility gap of about 2.46 children.
 Consistent with the proposition that households that have a first-born
 girl are likely to have more children conditional on age, we find that
 the gap is smaller than the first-born is a girl (2.26).
 In other words, households where the first-born is a girl will be closer
 to the theoretical maximal fertility than those that had a boy as the first-bor
n.
 The difference in the fertility gap between the group of households with
 a first born boy and a first born girl is significant (p=0.003).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third and fourth column present the same statistics, but now looks a
 the sex of the first two children.
 We now look three possible scenarios.
 If the first two children are both boys, we expect that the chance that
 they have extra children will be lowest.
 We find the probability of adding children in this case to be just over
 13 percent (top panel).
 If the first was a girl and the second was also a girl, we expect the probabili
ty to have additional children to be highest.
 In this case, there is indeed an almost 14 percent chance that they add
 at least one child to the household.
 For those that had a first girl but their second child was a boy, we expect
 the probability of increasing household size to lie between the two, which
 is indeed the case.
 The lower panel shows that the gap between actual and potential household
 size is also largest when the first two children are boys.
 The gap is smallest when the first two children are both girls.
 All this again confirms our proposition that boy preference affects fertility.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, in columns 5 and 6, we propose the share or female children in
 the total number of children as a potential instrument.
 As already stated above, because of boy preference, female children are
 likely to live in larger families and so we expect a positive correlation
 between this measure and household size.
 For now, we simply divide the sample in two, conditional on whether more
 or less than half of the children are female.
 We find that the average number of children is indeed smaller in the sub-sample
 where less than half of the children are girls as opposed to the sub-sample
 where the majority are girls (top panel, 2.78 children as opposed to 2.88).
 We also find a difference in the fertility gap that is significant with
 associated p-value of 0.021 (bottom panel).
 Households where girls are in a majority are closer to the theoretical
 maximal household size.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Agricultural Labour Supply
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we will briefly look at some descriptive statistics on labour
 supply in agriculture, one of the prime pathways through which fertility
 is likely to affect productivity and well-being.
 Most of Uganda has two cropping seasons.
 The first runs from January to June.
 The second cropping season is from July to December.
 The UNHS 2005/06 interviewed households twice over the course of one year
 to capture this feature.
 It visited households in the beginning of 2005 to capture the second cropping
 season in 2004 (that is, running from July to December 2004).
 Households were revisited at the end of 2005 to record information from
 the first cropping season in 2005 (running from January to June 2005).
 In our study, we will only consider the 2004 July to December cropping
 season, as data for labour allocation in agriculture was unavailable for
 the 2005 cropping season.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The dimensions are mother, father or child; land preparation, input application,

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Women seem to do most of the work, and child labour is restricted to about
 one day per crop and activity during the entire season
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
While the relationship between fertility and child labour is an important
 research question, we will not consider this in the present study.
 Reported child labour seems small in Uganda.
 More importantly, the instruments we propose in this study (gender of first
 born child/children and sex composition of children within the household)
 are likely to directly influence days worked in agriculture by the children,
 instead of only through fertility, risking to violate the exclusion restriction.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 This already indicates that the trade-off between the time lost by the
 mother because of rearing the children and the time gained by extra hands
 is likely to work against agricultural production.
 Typical for Uganda is the low amount of time spent on applying inputs.
 Farmers in Uganda use very limited amounts of fertilizer and other inputs,
 so also the time spend on applying them is small.
 There is also some heterogeneity in the time spend on different crops.
 For instance, matooke is allocated less time than maize, both for men and
 for women.
 However, there are also difference between the sexes.
 For instance, women spend much more time cultivating sweet potatoes, and
 to a lesser extent beans, than men.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Production
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also investigate the effect of fertility on production of some of the
 most important crops.
 More in particular, we look at the effect of fertility on the likelihood
 that a household cultivates each of the five most important crops.
 The first row in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:2averages"

\end_inset

 reports on the percentage of households that grow each of the crops.
 Over 50 percent report growing maize, beans and cassava.
 We also look at the impact on area cultivated, measured in acres.
 Households on average allocate about half an acre to maize.
 The least space is reserved for sweet potatoes.
 We also express area cultivated as a share of total area under cultivation.
 We find that about 17 percent of total land area is allocated to maize,
 while only 8 percent is allocated to sweet potatoes.
 The next line reports average production in kilograms at the household
 level.
 This may seem low, but this because households that report not to produce
 the crop are also part of the average.
 We also divide by household size.
 Finally, we report yields for the five crops, defined as the amount of
 each crop harvested per unit of land (per acre).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also aggregate the different corps by weighing them to average prices.
 We use prices from FoodNet.
 In particular, we average prices observed in Kampala's Nakawa market over
 the July to December 2004 period.
 Doing so, we find that the average total value derived from these five
 crops is about UGX98,500, which translates to about UGX45,000 per capita

 About 40 percent of the households in their reproductive age does not cultivate
 any of these five crops.
 On average, about 0.69 acres is allocated to these five crops.
 The yield per acre is about UGX220,220.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we present the results of our two-stage least squares estimates
 that look at the causal impact of fertility on various agricultural related
 outcomes.
 We start by presenting the first stage regression that regresses the our
 proposed instruments on the fertility gap.
 We then give a detailed description of the second stage regression that
 focuses on the effect of fertility on agricultural labour supply.
 We also explore the effect of fertility on area planted, production and
 productivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The first stage regression
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results for the first stage regression that link sex of first child/children
 to fertility are reported in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:firststage"

\end_inset

.
 The dependent variable, as explained above, is the difference between the
 maximum number of children of a typical woman at her age and the actual
 number of children born from the mother
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The maximum number of children has been estimated from the DHS and is actually
 the 95th percentile.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We refer to this as the fertility gap (
\emph on
fgap
\emph default
) or fertility shortfall.
 It actually is the reverse of fertility, as the higher the gap, the lower
 the number of children in the household in a given age cohort.
 Apart from the exogenous variable that is excluded from the second stage
 regression elaborated in the next sections, we include a series of control
 variables that are clearly exogenous to fertility in all 4 specifications
 of the first stage.
 The first exogenous control variable, 
\emph on
femhead,
\emph default
 is a an indicator variable that takes the value of 1 if the household head
 is female.
 The second, 
\emph on
urban
\emph default
, is an indicator variable that takes the value of 1 if the household resides
 in an urban area
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In some specifications where we expect regional variation in the outcome
 variable to be important, such as for production and yields for certain
 crops, we also include dummies for the four regions in both the first and
 second stage equations.
 This addition did not significantly change other estimated parameters in
 the first stage.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Next, we include three dummies to account for the education level of the
 mother.
 
\emph on
mprim
\emph default
 take the value of 1 if the mother has completed primary eduction.
 
\emph on
msec
\emph default
 is the additional effect of having completed secondary education.
 
\emph on
mthird
\emph default
 is the additional effect of the mother having completed tertiary education.
 The comparison category are therefore households where the mother did not
 complete at least primary education.
 We also add two community variables which are likely to influence household
 size.
 These are 
\emph on
school 
\emph default
which is a dummy variable that takes the value of one if there is a school
 in the village, and 
\emph on
health,
\emph default
 which is a dummy that takes the value of one if there is a public health
 centre or clinic in the community.
 Finally, we also add an indicator (
\emph on
cdied
\emph default
) that takes the value of one if a son or daughter of the mother has died
 in the past.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We experiment with four different possible excluded instruments.
 Model (1) uses an indicator that takes the value of one if the first-born
 in the household is a girl as an excluded instrument (
\emph on
oldestgirl
\emph default
).
 The coefficient is significant at the one percent level and has the expected
 sign.
 Having a girl as the first-born offspring reduces that fertility gap by
 about 0.2 children.
 In other words, households that have a girl as a first-born tend to be
 closer to maximal fecundity.
 For the controls, we find that households where females are the head have
 a significantly larger fertility gap.
 The effect is very large, suggesting such mothers have more than 1 child
 less.
 Also in urban areas, households seem to have significantly less children.
 Schooling of the mother seems to reduce the number of children only at
 secondary and tertiary level.
 There seems to be some indication that mothers that completed primary education
 have a slightly smaller fertility gap than mothers that did not even complete
 primary education.
 The community variables do not seem to have an effect on the fertility
 gap.
 Finally, having lost a child in the past leaves a significant additional
 fertility gap compared to households that never lost a child.
 However, the additional gap is much lower than one, suggesting a substantial
 replacement effect in Ugandan fertility.
 The constant indicates that the overall average fertility gap is about
 two children.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Model (2) uses an indicator that equals one if the first two children born
 to the mother in the household are both girls as excluded instrument (
\emph on
2oldestgirls
\emph default
).
 Using this instrument only makes sense if we confine ourselves to households
 that have at least two children, hence the reduction in the sample size.
 As in (1) the parameter on the excluded instrument is significantly negative,
 in line with our hypothesis.
 The control variables are very close to the what they were in model (1).
 Model (3) goes one step further and considers the first three children.
 In this case, the indicator, 
\emph on
3oldestgirls
\emph default
 is one only if the three first children are all girls.
 This again only makes sense in households that have at least three children,
 further reducing the sample size.
 The coefficient estimate is again negative, but this time it is not significant
 anymore.
 We assume that the reduced sample size in this model may have reduced the
 power of the t-test too much.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Model (4) uses a continuous variable as an excluded instrument (
\emph on
percentfemales
\emph default
).
 We calculated the share of girls among children as a share of the total
 number of children in the household.
 Again, the coefficient on this instrument has the expected sign.
 A higher share of females within the households is associated with a smaller
 fertility gap.
 This is consistent with 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, who observe the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

try until you have a boy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 fertility rule leads to an outcome where larger households have on average
 more girls.
 Again, the other variables are similar to the previous models.
 We find that an all female siblings household (
\emph on
percentfemales
\emph default
 = 1) will be on average 0.28 children larger than an all boys siblings household
 (
\emph on
percentfemales
\emph default
 = 0).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While most of our instruments are significant and have the expected sign,
 they explain only a small part of the variance in the outcome.
 When all exogenous controls are included, the R-squared is indeed rather
 low.
 If we run partial regressions, regressing the excluded instruments one
 by one on the dependent variable, the R-square drops below 1 percent.
 The F-value of a regression with only excluded instruments, another important
 indicator of the strength of the instruments according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "1995"

\end_inset

, also drops to 9.46

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As a rule of thumb, it is often stated that one has weak instruments if
 this F-statistic is smaller than 10.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In other words, we have serious concerns that our instruments are weak.
 We therefore use inference that is robust to weak instruments.
 In particular, we rely on the Anderson-Rubin test statistic to gauge the
 significance of the endogenous variable in all subsequent regressions

Household labour supply
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now turn to the effect of fertility on total household adult labour supply
 (table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:totlabour"

\end_inset

).
 We will also look at labour supply separately for the mother and the father
 (table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:2SLS-estimates-of"

\end_inset

).
 We will also look at labour supply by activity (table

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

, we investigate the effect of our main variable of interest, the fertility
 shortfall, on the number of days worked in agriculture (land preparation,
 input application, weeding and harvesting)
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We have also done this analysis using days worked per acre of land held
 by the household.
 However, since average land holdings are about 1.1 acre and there seems
 to be no systematic relationship between farm size and labour supply, the
 results are very similar.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The first column of the table reports the result without taking into account
 endogeneity of number of children.
 It reports Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimates that explain the number
 of days adults reported to have worked on the household farm in the 2004
 agricultural season.
 Agricultural work is defined as work related to land preparation, input
 application, weeding and harvesting.
 We see that there is no significant correlation between the number of days
 worked and fertility as measured by the fertility gap.
 We do find significant and negative effects of the household being headed
 by a female (
\emph on
femhead
\emph default
) and the household being located in an urban area (
\emph on
urban
\emph default
).
 Primary and secondary education of mothers (
\emph on
mprim
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
msec
\emph default
) does not seem to be systematically related to the number of days worked
 in agriculture, but mothers that finished tertiary education (
\emph on
mthird
\emph default
) appear to work less in agriculture.
 The OLS estimates also show positive correlations between a school in the
 community (
\emph on
school
\emph default
) and days worked in agriculture and between a deceased child in the past
 (
\emph on
cdead
\emph default
) and days worked.
 There is also some indication of a positive correlation between health
 centers in the community (
\emph on
health
\emph default
) and days worked.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Models (2) to (4) estimate the same models, but instrument the fertility
 gap with a single excluded instrument.
 In model (2), the instrument is an indicator taking the value of one if
 the first-born is a girl.
 The coefficient on the fertility gap now becomes positive and significant
 at a 10 percent level, implying that higher fertility (and hence a shrinking
 fertility gap) causes a reduction in the number of days worked on the family
 fields.
 Model (3) uses the sex of the first and second born as instruments for
 the fertility gap.
 Model (4) uses the share of daughters as an instrument.
 The estimate of the fertility effect becomes higher, and is now significant
 even at a 1 percent significance level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, model (5) uses both the gender of the first-born and the share
 of daughters as the excluded instruments
\begin_inset Foot

We use Limited Information Maximum Likelihood (LIML), as this is known to

.
 According to the Hansen-J statistic, our model that uses multiple instruments
 is valid (Hansen-J=0.849; p-val=0.357).
 We thus assume this is the best specification.
 Each additional child causes a reduction of about 66 days of labour in
 agriculture.
 With respect to the other variables in the regression, we find some signs
 that households with women that have finished tertiary education appear
 to be less engaged in agriculture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

, we differentiate between work done by the mother and the father.
 For the sake of space, we only show the coefficient on the fertility gap,
 but we also added the exogenous control variables that were also included
 in the first stage regression.
 Full results can be found in the appendix.
 The top panel in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:2SLS-estimates-of"

\end_inset

 shows the effect of fertility on time worked in agriculture by the mother.
 The OLS estimate is not significant (model (1)).
 Accounting for endogeneity of fertility using the exogenous variation caused
 by the sex of the first-born renders the fertility gap significant at a
 5 percent level (model (2)).
 An increase in the fertility gap per age cohort by one child leads a mother
 to work almost 30 days more in subsistence farming.
 Cycling through the results with the alternative instruments, the results
 change little with respect to significance.
 In all, an additional child seems to reduce number of days worked by the
 mother in agricultural production by about 40 days.
 Full results are reported in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the first column of the second panel, we report the same OLS regression
 but with the number of days worked by adult males as the dependent variable.
 As is the case with female labour, the fertility gap does not seem to be
 correlated to male layout supply when we do not take into account the endogenou
s nature of fertility choices.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Effect-on-maileappend"

\end_inset

 in the appendix gives full results and the OLS results are in the first
 column.
 We find that residing in urban areas leads farmers reporting less days
 worked on the field.
 We also find a large negative effect of female headedness on days worked
 on agriculture related activities by the male.
 This is because, in most cases, households are headed by females because
 the male head is missing, leading to less days reported on the field.
 We also find some evidence of males working less if the mother has higher
 eduction.
 This is most likely because higher educated men choose higher educated
 women to marry and the other way around.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Judged by the instrumental variable models from (2) to (5) the effect of
 fertility on labour supply by the father is less clear cut.
 When using the sex of the first born (model 2) and the sex of the first
 two children born (model 3) as instruments, the coefficient is positive
 but not significantly different from zero.
 If we instrument the fertility gap using the percentage of females, we
 find some indication that more children may reduce time allocated to working
 on the field my males.
 The effect, however, is only half the size of the reductions found for
 women.
 The over-identified model in model (5) shows a significant effect at the
 10 percent level only.
 These findings are similar to what others have found.
 For instance, in their study on labour supply response to fertility in
 the United States, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:aea:aecrev:v:88:y:1998:i:3:p:450-77"

 in response to more children.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_layout Standard
Table

 Again, the results reported in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:2SLS-estimates-allocation"

\end_inset

 only show the coefficients on the fertility gap.
 Full results are in the appendix.
 Model (1) in the top panel presents OLS results for number of days worked
 on land preparation.
 There are no effects from fertility in this specification.
 Again, as expected, households residing in urban areas spend significantly
 less time preparing land.
 Female headed households also allocate less time to land preparation.
 There is also some indication that women that have tertiary education are
 less engaged in land preparation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Model (2) presents the same model, but instruments fertility with the indicator
 for the first child being a girl.
 The fertility effect now becomes positive, but is not significantly different
 from zero.
 In model (3), where we look at the sex of the first two children, the fertility
 gap effect becomes significant.
 The effect remains significant when we instrument the fertility shortfall
 by the percentage of females born (model (4)) and in the over-identified
 model (5), but the effect size reduces.
 An additional child reduces time allocated to land preparation by about
 25 days.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second panel repeats the same five models, but uses days spent on input
 application as the dependent variable.
 In none of the five specifications, fertility seems to have a significant
 impact.
 Overall, time spend on input application is very limited anyway, as can
 be seen in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Average-hours-worked"

\end_inset

.
 In all, households spend only about one day applying inputs (including
 planting).
 The only significant effect we find is that households where the mother
 has at least primary education allocate more time to input application
 (table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:applappend"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third panel presents results for time spend on weeding.
 The results are similar to the ones for land preparation, but the effects
 are smaller.
 Each extra child reduces time allocated to weeding by about 20 days.
 Full results in the appendix (table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:timeweeding"

\end_inset

) show significant negative effects for female headed households and for
 households in urban areas.
 We also find that communities that have a health center are spending less
 days on weeding.
 Finally, the last panel looks at the effects of fertility on days worked
 for harvesting.
 There is no significant positive association between the number of children
 in the family and the number of days spend harvesting if we use only our
 binary instrument.
 We find a positive effect if we instrument the fertility gap by the share
 of girls among siblings, but the effect is small compared to the other
 effects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above suggests that fertility affects time allocated to land preparation
 and weeding in a negative way.
 Harvesting seems to be less related to family size.
 Probably, when crops are ready to be harvested, farmers are more likely
 to put in the extra effort.
 This seems to be less evident for work that has an uncertain payoff in
 the future, such as weeding.
 The reductions of time allocated to land preparation and weeding may reduce
 both area planted and agricultural productivity.
 We will turn to this in the next section.

We will now look at the effect of fertility on production and productivity.
 We will look at productivity defined as kilograms harvested per acre of
 the five most important products separately.
 We will also look the value of total production, the value of production
 per acre and the value of production per capita.

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:2SLS-estimates-area"

\end_inset

 reports on the second stage regressions of different aspects of production
 for the five most important crops.
 The table only reports the results for the coefficient on the fertility
 gap for the instrumental variable regression that uses the share of girls
 as excluded instrument.
 The regressions include the same control variables as in the previous sections.
 However, we now also added regional dummies, as some crops are grown more
 in some regions than in others.
 If the dependent variable is binary or censored, a tobit or probit is estimated
 using the methods described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first row looks at the probability that a household grows the respective
 crop.
 For instance, the first entry in the first row tells us that the fertility
 gap does not affect the probability that households cultivate maize.
 The third entry, however, shows that households that have a higher fertility
 gap are more likely to grow beans.
 Similarly, we find that higher fertility significantly reduces the probability
 that matooke is grown.
 The next row looks at the total area reported to be used to grow each crop,
 measured in acres.
 We find a positive effect of the fertility gap on the area used to grow
 matooke.
 Fertility seems to be unrelated to the area used to grow any of the other
 crops.
 However, smaller households that grow more matooke may simply have larger
 land holdings.
 Therefore, it will be useful to also relate fertility to the share of each
 crop in total in terms of land size.
 This gives an idea of the relative importance of each crop within the household.
 This is presented in the next row.
 In this case, it seems that households with more children allocate less
 land as a share of total land to sweet potatoes.
 The next row looks at the value of production in kilograms.
 Only for matooke, larger households seem to obtain a significantly lower
 quantity of matooke.
 The next row looks at production per capita.
 The lower production of matooke persists if we account for household size.
 Finally, for none of the products, the fertility gap has a significant
 effect on yield.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:2SLS-totals"

\end_inset

 we present results on total production and productivity, using the prices
 for the different crops.
 We present again five different models.
 The first one is again regression that does not take endogeneity into account.
 While in the previous regressions this was typically OLS, this may now
 change to a probit or tobit regression, depending on the nature of the
 dependent variable.
 The second regression instruments the fertility gap with the sex of the
 first-born.
 The third model uses the sex of the first two children born to the mother
 and the fourth uses the share of women amongst the children.
 As before, the fourth model instruments the fertility difference by two
 instruments: the sex of the first-born and the share of girls among the
 children.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first row gives results for the change in production.
 There seems to be no detectable effect from fertility on the total value
 of the production of the five crops.
 The second row expresses this production in per capita terms.
 The OLS estimates show a positive effect of an increase in the fertility
 gap.
 However, if we confine to the exogenous part of fertility in the IV regressions
, the effect disappears.
 The next row looks at a change in the total area allocated to the five
 crops.
 There is again no significant effect from fertility.
 The final row, which looks at productivity defined as the total value of
 the five crops divided by the total area allocated to these five crops,
 also finds no causal impact from family size.

\begin_layout Section*
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we look at the effect of fertility, defined as the number
 of biological children born to the mother, on agricultural production and
 its determinants.
 One of the most evident determinants is household agricultural labour.
 The identification strategy we use relies on the premise that, in partilineal
 societies, boys are preferred to girls in terms of offspring.
 Households that have a girl as the first child will have a higher propensity
 to add more children to the household.
 The fact that the sex of the first child is exogenous can be used to identify
 the causal impact of additional children on other variables such as labour
 supply and productivity.
 Similarly, the fertility rule whereby one is more likely to stop having
 children after a boy means that, on average, larger households consist
 of more girls.
 Therefore, the share of females in the total number of children can also
 be used as an instrument.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our first stage regression performs reasonably well.
 We find a significant negative effect of an indicator variable that the
 first-born is a girl on a variable that measures the shortfall from fecundity.
 We equally find a negative effect of an indicator that the first two children
 are female.
 Finally, we also find that households with a relatively higher share of
 girls are negatively related to the fertility gap.
 While our instruments are significant and have the correct sign, explanatory
 power as measured by the partial R-squared is low.
 We therefore use inference methods in the second stage that are robust
 to weak instruments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second stage regression, we find that fertility affects both time
 women and men allocated to agricultural production.
 However, most of the labour time lost as a consequence of an exogenous
 increase in children is born by the woman.
 Especially land preparation and weeding are activities that seem to suffer
 from excessive fertility.
 When we look at crops, we find that only matooke and sweet potatoes are
 significantly affected by fertility.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Matooke is the most important stable crop in Uganda, providing 18 percent
 of caloric intake 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "RePEc:ags:midcwp:58553"

\end_inset

.
 The finding that young households that have higher fertility are reducing
 the most important source of calories suggests that higher fertility also
 causes under-nutrition.
 Sweet potatoes is also a typical food security crop, with a low return
 but also low risk 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "RePEc:ucp:ecdecc:v:44:y:1996:i:3:p:485-513"

\end_inset

.
 It is also a crop that is mostly under the control of the woman, who does
 much of the work on the field.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That said, the fact that we rely on a cross-section of households also limits
 to what extent our conclusions can be generalized.
 It may well be that households that are at a later stage in their life
 cycle profit much more from larger household size.
 For instance, in households where the mother has reduced fertility, she
 may have more time to work in agricultural activities.
 In addition, children may provide cheap and flexible labour at a later
 age.
 Therefore, we want to stress that our results only hold for the subset
 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

young
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 households, where the women is between 16 and 32.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are different ways in which the negative effect of fertility on labour
 and production can be influenced.
 First, our analysis reconfirms the need for fertility reducing policies.
 Apart from known fertility reducing policies such as women education and
 improved maternal health care, the most promising policies would try to
 work on the root cause of increased fertility.
 This should be done by reducing the propensity of households to have higher
 fertility if the first-born is a girl.
 We think of a host of policies that go against the patrilineal nature of
 these societies.
 For example, Uganda may consider changing its land act similar to what
 Kenya recently did and give equal inheritance rights to both girls and
 boys.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above policy response involves addressing cultural issues related to
 high fertility, some of which may face considerable resistance.
 Changing a set of cultural values is likely to be a very slow process.
 Meanwhile, the government of Uganda should support the nutritional needs
 of young families.
 It should also consider introducing agricultural technologies that save
 on agricultural labour, especially for women.

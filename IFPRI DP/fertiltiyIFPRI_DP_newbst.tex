\begin{abstract}
Human fertility is likely to affect agricultural production through
its effect on the supply of agricultural labor. Using the fact that
in traditional, patriarchal societies sons are often preferred to
daughters, we isolated exogenous variation in the number of children
born to a mother and related it to agricultural labor supply and production
outcomes in Uganda - a country that combines a dominant agricultural
sector with one of the highest fertility rates in the world. We found
that fertility has a sizable negative effect on household labor allocation
to subsistence agriculture. Households with lower fertility devote
significantly more time to land preparation and weeding, while larger
households grow less matooke and sweet potatoes. We found no significant
effect on agricultural productivity as measured in terms of yield
per land area.

Keywords: fertility, labor supply, instrumental variables, boy preference.

\section*{Introduction}

At the most basic level, subsistence farmers in rural Africa combine
natural with human resources to make a living. They use mainly household
labor on their own small plots to produce food for their own consumption.
Accordingly, the quantity of family members available for agricultural
labor is an important determinant of wellbeing. More children means
mothers, and to a lesser extent fathers, will need to spend more time
caring for children, meaning less time will be available to spend
on agricultural activities. Since women are known to supply most of
the agricultural labor, the loss in time due care for offspring and
additional rest needed during pregnancies may hurt subsistence households
disproportionately. 

Uganda has one of the highest fertility rates in the world. Even in
the context of large reductions in child mortality rates, total fertility
rates remain stubbornly high. On average, Ugandan women in rural areas
bear 6.8 children over the course of their reproductive lives \citep{New9}.
At the same time, a substantial part of the population lives in rural
areas making a living out of semi-subsistence agriculture. Ugandan
agriculture accounts for about 35 percent of gross domestic product
and employs about 73 percent of the active labor force. Virtually
all households that reside in rural areas engage in farming, and about
80 percent are small-scale, semi-subsistence farmers. The question
of how fertility affects wellbeing through its effect on household
labor supply and agricultural production is therefore relevant. For
example, knowledge of how fertility affects time allocation by different
categories within the household is important to gender-stream efforts
related to crop intensification and commercialization.

In this study, we investigated the effect of fertility on agricultural
production at the household level. In particular, we investigated
the effect of the number of biological children on household member
labor input in agriculture (further categorized as land preparation,
weeding, input application, and harvesting). We also looked at the
effect of fertility on crop portfolio, area cultivated, production
and productivity for the five most important crops. However, fertility
is a choice variable to agricultural households. For instance, mothers
who work long hours in the field may try to avoid becoming pregnant
because this would only increase their hardship. If fertility, agricultural
labor allocation and agricultural production were jointly determined,
just looking at correlations would be misleading, and so we needed
to find a way to separate the exogenous variation from the part that
is jointly determined.

Our identification strategy was a simple but powerful quasi-experimental
approach inspired by the work of \citet{RePEc:aea:aecrev:v:88:y:1998:i:3:p:450-77}.
We used the fact that in conservative, patriarchal societies such
as Uganda's, male off-spring are generally preferred to female. This
preference and the random nature of the newborns' sex determination
gives rise to particular fertility patterns. For example, households
that have a girl as the firstborn are likely to have more children
\citep{Jayachandran01082011}. In other words, we used the sex of
off-spring as an instrumental variable (IV) to determine the exogenous
component of fertility at the household level. We expected that such
a Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) approach would yield consistent estimates
for the causal effect of fertility on agricultural labor supply and
associated agricultural production within the household.

There is an active debate among labor economists on the relationship
between fertility and labor supply. \citet{RePEc:aea:aecrev:v:88:y:1998:i:3:p:450-77}
used the fact that American couples prefer to have children of different
sexes, and that they are likely to keep trying if the first two are
of the same sex, as a source of exogenous variation. We argue that
in a developing country context, the sex of the firstborn makes more
sense as an instrument. Indeed, this instrumentation strategy has
been used in such a context. \citet{doi:10.1080/00220380500356779}
used the sex of the first two children to predict exogenous variation
in fertility in India and its effect on wellbeing. We thought it was
too ambitious to relate fertility directly to poverty and related
measures of consumption because the sex of the first two children
may directly affect consumption, violating the exclusion restriction.
We restricted ourselves to the agricultural labor allocation of adult
household members, area planted and production. In addition, most
studies that look at the effects of fertility on labor allocation
in a developing country context use data from Asian countries. The
high incidence of selective abortion in these countries may mean the
sex of the first child or children becomes endogenous as well. This
was likely to be much less of a problem in our application, which
is, to our knowledge, the first such application to an African country.

We found that the sex of the firstborn, the sex of the first two children
born, and the percentage of girls as a share of the total number of
children all significantly explain observed fertility, measured as
the gap between actual children born and a theoretical maximal fecundity
for each age cohort. Fertility has a strong negative effect on the
number of days the mother works in the field. We also find some evidence
of a negative effect on the father, but the size of the effect is
only half of that on the mother. Households with lower fertility devote
significantly more time to land preparation and weeding. We also found
that smaller households produce more matooke. This effect holds to
a lesser extent for sweet potatoes. We found no impact on yields. 

This article is organized as follows. The next section gives a brief
overview of the most prominent papers that are related to our study.
Then, we make our case for the use of the sex of the firstborn as
an instrument, using literature that documents child gender and reproductive
behavior. We then present the data we used in our application, and
describe the main variables we will used in the analysis. Next, we
present the results. In this section, we first take a close look at
the first stage regression. We then look at the effect of fertility
on household labor supply, considering differential effects depending
on specific agricultural labor activities. We then turn to the effect
of household size on aspects of agricultural production and productivity.
A final section concludes.


\section*{Related Studies}

Fertility and the related concept of household size affects household
wellbeing through consumption and production. \citet{RePEc:ecj:econjl:v:105:y:1995:i:433:p:1415-34}
focused on the consumption side effects of household size in a developing
country context. They noted the contradiction between widely-held
views that larger households are often poorer (due to increased competition
for food) and scale economies in consumption. They found that, if
economies of scale are accounted for within households, the negative
correlation between household size and consumption expenditure disappears.
On the production side of the farm household, the effect of household
size is equally ambiguous. Some may argue that larger households have
more labor available within the household. The additional advantage
of this labor is that it is not subject to the moral hazard effects
often attributed to hired labor%
\footnote{For instance, \citet{RePEc:eee:deveco:v:18:y:1985:i:2-3:p:297-313}
argues this may the reason why small farms appear to be more efficient
than large farms%
}. But at the same time, more dependents within the household means
more time needs to be allocated to caring for them. Also, agricultural
labor and agricultural production may be subject to diminishing returns. 

The relationship between fertility and household labor supply has
been studied most carefully in the field of labor economics. Since
this literature is so extensive, we only mention two of the most influential
works here. The first is \citet{RePEc:aea:aecrev:v:88:y:1998:i:3:p:450-77},
who attempted to quantify the effect of fertility on labor supply
in the US. They dealt with the endogeneity of the number of a woman's
children by exploiting the fact that Americans tend to prefer two
sibling genders in their households. They argued that parents of same-sex
siblings are significantly and substantially more likely to go on
to have an additional child. They found that more children does indeed
reduce the women's participation in the labor force, but that the
effect is less pronounced than previous studies had suggested. They
found no effect on the labor force participation by the fathers.

Another paper that tried to answer the same question is \citet{RePEc:ucp:jpolec:v:88:y:1980:i:2:p:328-48}.
In this paper, the exogenous variation in the number of children was
obtained by using the occurrence of multiple births (twins) at first
birth as an instrument. The authors argued that the comparison between
women who gave birth to a singleton at first birth and women who gave
birth to twins at first birth allowed them to identify the causal
effect of an extra child on an outcome (in their case labor supply).
Since the occurrence of twins is exogenous, there was no danger that
heterogeneity in women's preferences contaminated the estimated coefficients.
The study found that household size reduces female labor supply, but
that the effect is only temporary%
\footnote{In addition to studies that investigate the causal effect of household
size on (female) labor supply, there are also a range of papers that
test Becker's quantity-quality fertility model \citep{RePEc:nbr:nberch:2387,RePEc:ucp:jpolec:v:81:y:1973:i:2:p:s279-88}.
Many of these articles also used twins \citep{RePEc:ecm:emetrp:v:48:y:1980:i:1:p:227-40,RePEc:tpr:qjecon:v:120:y:2005:i:2:p:669-700}
and/or sibling sex composition \citep{New1,RePEc:ucp:jlabec:v:28:y:2010:i:4:p:773-824}
as instruments.%
}.

\citet{doi:10.1080/00220380500356779} used the sex of the first two
children as a natural experiment and found that household size increased
poverty in India. They used essentially the same argument as we make
in the next section. However, welfare, and the related concept of
poverty, rely on consumption per capita. Consumption per capita as
the independent variable is likely to be problematic in a two-stage
least squares setting. There is a real danger that the instrumental
variable will affect the outcome variable directly, instead of only
through its influence on family size. For instance, if boys consume
on average more than girls, the exclusion restriction would be violated.
There is also some evidence from Indonesia. \citet{RePEc:dem:demres:v:20:y:2009:i:26}
looked at the relation between consumption and fertility. \citet{RePEc:iza:izadps:dp2162},
related fertility to the allocation of labor within households. However,
they moved away from the direct instrumental variable approach that
is standard and instead estimated a reproduction function taking into
account endogenous contraceptive choice. 

All the above studies employed data from Asia. It is well known that
gender at birth is already skewed in many Asian countries. For instance
India, from which \citet{doi:10.1080/00220380500356779} drew their
sample, is particularly known for selective abortion of girls \citep{New8}.
This non-random distribution of sex of children opens the door to
potential correlation between the instrument and the error term of
the structural equation. One example would be that less educated,
poorer households that depend heavily on agriculture engage more in
the abortion of female fetuses. In the context of weak instruments,
such correlation can seriously bias estimates \citep{1995}. 

In this paper, we will try to address some of the above challenges.
We used the sex of the firstborn and variations thereof as our instrumental
variables. We will relate fertility to agricultural labor supply and
agricultural production, since there is a direct link between these
three variables. We will also concentrate on Africa. Here, while there
is a boy preference, reproduction rate norms are high and the cost
of raising children is low. This means that selective abortion is
much less of a concern. 


\section*{Boy preference and Fertility}

There is quite a bit of evidence that parents prefer boys over girls
in many developing countries%
\footnote{In developed countries, there is a preference for a mix of sexes among
children, as shown in, for example \citet{RePEc:aea:aecrev:v:88:y:1998:i:3:p:450-77}.%
}. For instance there is a large body of literature that looks at correlations
between sex and variables related to wellbeing or quality of children.
Significant differences in these outcomes are then considered proof
of sex bias. \citet{New5} and \citet{New6} looked at excess mortality
among female infants in India. \citet{New7} and \citet{testit} investigated
differential access to health, in Bangladesh and India respectively.
\citet{RePEc:oup:oxecpp:v:40:y:1988:i:1:p:32-54} and \citet{doi:10.1080/713600059}
found a correlation between sex and nutrition and \citet{RePEc:ucp:jpolec:v:90:y:1982:i:1:p:52-73},
\citet{RePEc:ier:iecrev:v:36:y:1995:i:3:p:795-818}, and \citet{RePEc:eee:streco:v:9:y:1998:i:4:p:453-468}
all investigated correlations between the gender of children and education.

However, at a more basic level, boy preference is already revealed
by parents who, if asked in surveys, for example, often state clearly
that they prefer boys to girls. Such preferences lead to a particular
decision rule with respect to fertility, where the likelihood that
children are added to the household is positively correlated to the
number of surviving girls in the household. The preference for boys
over girls results in what \citet{Jayachandran01082011} refer to
as the ``stop-after-a-son'' fertility pattern. There are indeed
many studies that show empirically that in settings characterized
by son preference, a couple that has just had a son is more likely
to stop having children \citep{RePEc:spr:demogr:v:24:y:1987:i:4:p:517-530}
or wait longer to have the next child \citep{RePEc:spr:demogr:v:22:y:1985:i:2:p:145-168,New4,RePEc:spr:demogr:v:37:y:2000:i:1:p:95-108,RePEc:bla:popdev:v:27:y:2001:i:1:p:33-63}. 

\citet{Jayachandran01082011} argued that son preference leads mothers
to breastfeed daughters and children without brothers for a relatively
shorter time. Since breastfeeding is an effective birth control method,
this observed behavior also explains why couples with a son seem to
wait longer before they have the next child. In addition, this underlying
consequence of sex bias may partly explain a range of outcomes observed
in the area of health, mortality and possibly even educational attainment.
The model that \citet{Jayachandran01082011} develop shows that even
when parents want both boys and girls to have the same health and
education, disparities can arise passively because of fertility preferences.
The model shows that a ``try until you have a boy'' fertility rule
results in girls having on average more siblings, leading to more
competition for resources within the household. 

The occurrence of boy preference is explained by various cultural
and economic factors documented in the anthropological and demographic
literature. In countries where no formal, risk-free old age insurance
(such as pensions) is available, parents may choose to invest more
in children who will have a higher chance of being able to support
them in old age \citep{RePEc:ucp:jpolec:v:90:y:1982:i:1:p:52-73}.
Anthropological and demographic evidence emphasize the dominant role
of males in traditional patrilineal societies where descent and inheritance
are transmitted through the male line. Furthermore, male children
strengthen the relationship between the wife and her husband's kin
(by guaranteeing the continuation of his lineage) and secure the mother's
access to inheritance and a place to live upon the husband's death.
Older women have power through their sons and rule over their daughters-in-law
\citep{KANDIYOTI01091988}. The spread of primary schooling in sub-Saharan
Africa has also affected fertility patterns \citep{RePEc:bla:popdev:v:26:y:2000:i:3:p:483-515}.
Since boys are more likely to be sent (and kept) in school than girls,
the extra cost associated with primary schooling will be higher in
families with more boys. This, in turn, will encourage families who
already have boys to reduce fertility. 

Most of the evidence on the existence of boy preference comes from
Asian countries. There are relatively few inquiries into sex preference
in Sub Saharan Africa. Even more, it is often assumed that gender
preferences are much lower or even absent there. This is surprising,
since many of the cultural and economic factors that are observed
in Asia equally apply to Africa. One study that documents significant
gender bias in Africa is \citet{RePEc:oup:restud:v:77:y:2010:i:4:p:1262-1300},
who found skewed sex ratios at older age in favor of men. Another
study of a small community in Nigeria found that almost 90 percent
of surveyed respondents reported male sex preference \citep{New10}.
What is different from the Asian context, though, is that the female
gender deficit is not only present birth, but throughout the entire
age spectrum%
\footnote{The large effects documented in \citet{RePEc:oup:restud:v:77:y:2010:i:4:p:1262-1300}
have recently been attenuated in \citet{RePEc:got:gotcrc:133}, who
confirmed that only young adult women were missing within households.%
}. \citet{RePEc:wbk:wbrwps:6869} argued that gender bias is likely
not to be found at birth in the African context, where high fertility
is culturally valued and less costly for families that still rely
on support from the extended family system. In Uganda, preference
for boys has been extensively documented in \citet{New2}.

Even in Western societies, preference for firstborn sons, rather than
daughters, has been observed. For example, \citet{test} reported
an extensive list of studies that found men and/or women prefer a
boy as their firstborn. Even in the United States, \citet{RePEc:aea:aecrev:v:88:y:1998:i:3:p:450-77}
found some evidence of an association between having a male child
and reduced childbearing at higher parities - in addition to the mixed-child
preference. Accordingly, we felt that the sex of the firstborn (or
closely related indicators) would provide a valid instrument for fertility
at the household level in Uganda.


\section*{Data and Descriptive Statistics}

We used the Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS) 2005-2006,obtained
directly from the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS). Although it
is somewhat dated, we chose this survey because it has much more information
about agriculture than the more recent UNHS of 2009-2012, or that
of 2012-2013. The 2005-2006 UNHS we chose was structured with a standard
Living Standards Measurement Study - Integrated Survey on Agriculture
(LSMS-ISA) in mind- it collected detailed information on a sample
of almost 43,000 people in 7,500 households in Uganda.

Ideally, we would have liked to use a sample of households where all
desired children were born. The fact that we were working with a cross-section
of households in which women were at different stages of their reproductive
lives, created some problems. Assume a couple that has just formed
and is entering their reproductive stage. In our sample, such households
showed up with a smaller-than-average household size. Now, if the
firstborn happened to be a girl, this could have mistakenly been interpreted
as running against our hypothesis that households where the firstborn
was a girl would have higher fertility. On the other hand, if the
first child was a boy, this could have led us to put too much confidence
in our hypothesis, as the smaller household size was not only due
to the fact that the firstborn was a son, but also to the fact that
the household had only just entered its reproductive stage. The fact
that we were working with a cross-section of households rather than
historical data on all births by women who had reached the end of
their reproductive lives was also reflected in the average number
of children. This was only 3.13 children, while women bear almost
7 children over their entire reproductive period. 

To deal with this problem, we worked with the difference in the actual
number of children reported and the maximum reproductive capacity
for a woman at a certain age, rather than simply working with the
number of children in the household%
\footnote{Alternatively, one could use the number of children within the household
and control for the age of the mother. We have also run the analysis
using this strategy and came to virtually the same conclusions. %
}. We referred to this measure of fertility as the \emph{fertility
gap} or \emph{shortfall in fertility}. To get this fertility gap,
we would have needed to estimate the average age at menarche within
the population, and then simply divide into age the pregnancy period
plus post pregnancy lactation in-fecund period. In addition, we would
also have needed to incorporate the maternal mortality ratio for \textquotedbl{}censoring\textquotedbl{}
the lives of women who have had too many children and thus increased
mortality rates (and exit from the sample). Instead, we took the 95th
percentile of total fertility rates per age from the Demographic and
Health Survey of Uganda done in 2011 \citep{New9}. This is probably
a good approximation of the upper bound by age-of-fertility in the
population.

The selection of children was based on the household roster of the
UNHS 2005-2006. In particular, we selected individuals that were indicated
as son or daughter of the household head. There is another potential
problem when using a cross sectional survey such as the UNHS that
only looks at reported dependents currently living within the household
to calculate the difference between actual and theoretical fertility.
Older women may have been living in households where some of the older
children had already left the household. Thus, at around the age of
thirty, the gap between reported children in the household and theoretical
fertility would have started to increase more rapidly because of children
growing old enough to start households of their own. More troubling,
the reported gender of the oldest son or daughter living in the household
may not have been the gender of firstborn. To overcome this problem,
we restricted our sample to households where the mother was between
16 and 32. We chose the cut off age of 32 because at this age, the
mother's firstborn will turns 16, which is our entry age into the
sample of mothers. Restricting our sample in this way had a second
advantage. For some of the indirect outcome variables we used, such
as productivity, there was a risk that the gender of the firstborn
had a direct effect on the outcome, instead of only through fertility%
\footnote{For example, boys may have a different effect on productivity than
girls due to their physical differences.%
}. Restricting our sample to households with only young mothers meant
that the children were also likely to be younger, and thus less likely
to engage in agricultural production, making a violation of the exclusion
restriction less likely. 

Looking at the sex of the firstborn is only one possible strategy.
One may argue that the sex of the first born is not very relevant
in a context where women bear on average almost 7 children. Indeed,
it is likely that households will get a second child irrespective
of the sex of the first. This is supported by \citet{Jayachandran01082011},
who found that the difference in breastfeeding duration between boys
and girls is largest near target family size, when gender is most
predictive of subsequent fertility. Therefore, we not only used the
sex of the firstborn child as an instrument for fertility, but also
experimented with alternative instruments such as an indicator that
the first two children would be girls or a variable that expresses
the share of female children in the total family size. The next section
presents some preliminary statistics that suggest how gender patterns
in the household are related to fertility.


\subsubsection*{Gender of Offspring and Fertility}

This section makes a case for the different instruments used in the
analysis. While the next section runs a first stage regression, this
one presents some simple descriptive statistics to show that gender
of the first few children, as well as the share of male children in
a women's total number of children, affects fertility. Table \ref{tab:gender-and-fertility}
summarizes our findings. The first two columns in the top panel check
if households that have a daughter as firstborn are more likely to
have extra children. We simply calculated the percentage of households
that had more than one child conditional on their first born being
a son or a girl. In other words, we calculated the probability that
a household had at least one additional child (prop +1). We found
that in the sub-sample where the first child is a boy, about 37.46
percent of households would have at least one more child. However,
if the first child happened to be a girl, almost 40 percent of households
would have at least one more child. This confirmed our hypothesis
that households have a higher chance of adding children if the firstborn
is a girl.

We also looked at the effect of the firstborn's gender on the shortfall
that exists when actual fertility is compared with theoretical fertility.
The first two columns in the bottom panel report this fertility gap
for these two groups of households. We found that households that
have a boy as the firstborn child have an average fertility gap of
about 2.46 children. Consistent with the proposition that households
with a firstborn girl are likely to have more children conditional
on age, we found that the gap is smaller when the firstborn is a girl
(2.26). In other words, households where the firstborn is a girl are
closer to the theoretical maximal fertility than those households
whose firstborn is a boy. The difference in the fertility gap between
the group of households with a firstborn boy and the group with a
firstborn girl is significant (p=0.003).

The third and fourth column present the same statistics, but now looks
at the sex of the first two children. We looked at three possible
scenarios. If the first two children were both boys, we expected that
the chance that the household would have extra children would be lowest.
We found the probability of adding children in this case to be just
over 13 percent (top panel). If the first was a girl and the second
was also a girl, we expected the probability that the household would
have additional children to be highest. In this case, there was indeed
an almost 14 percent chance that a couple would add at least one child
to the household. For those households that had a girl first but whose
second child was a boy, we expected the probability of increasing
household size to lie between the two, which indeed turned out to
be the case. The lower panel shows that the gap between actual and
potential household size is also largest when the first two children
are boys. The gap is smallest when the first two children are both
girls. All this again confirms our proposition that boy preference
affects fertility.

Finally, columns 5 and 6 propose the share of female children in the
total number of a household's children as a potential instrument.
As already stated above, because of boy preference, female children
are likely to live in larger families and so we expected a positive
correlation between this measure and household size. For the time
being, we simply divided the sample in two, conditional on whether
more or less than half of the children were female. We found that
the average number of children was indeed smaller in the sub-sample
where less than half of the children were girls as opposed to the
sub-sample where the majority were girls (top panel, 2.78 children
as opposed to 2.88). We also found a difference in the fertility gap
that was significant with an associated p-value of 0.021 (bottom panel).
Households where girls were in a majority were closer to the theoretical
maximal household size. 


\subsubsection*{Agricultural labor Supply}

This section looks briefly at some descriptive statistics on labor
supply in agriculture, one of the prime pathways through which fertility
is likely to affect productivity and wellbeing. Most of Uganda has
two cropping seasons. The first runs from January to June. The second
is from July to December. The UNHS 2005-2006 interviewed households
twice over the course of one year to capture this feature. It visited
households in the beginning of 2005 to capture the second 2004 cropping
season (which runs from July to December 2004). Enumerators revisited
the households at the end of 2005 to record information from the first
2005 cropping season (which runs from January to June 2005). Our study
only considers the 2004 July to December cropping season, as data
for labor allocation in agriculture was unavailable for the 2005 cropping
season.

Figure \ref{fig:Average-hours-worked} shows time reported in the
fields along different dimensions%
\footnote{The dimensions are mother, father or child; land preparation, input
application, weeding and harvesting; and crop. The crops are the five
most widely grown crops in Uganda.%
}. Women seemed to do most of the work, and reported child labor was
negligible%
\footnote{While the relationship between fertility and child labor is an important
research question, we do not consider this in the present study. Reported
child labor occurrence indeed seems limited in Uganda. More importantly,
the instruments we propose in this study (gender of first born child/children
and sex composition of children within the household) are likely to
directly influence the number of days the children worked in agriculture,
instead of only through fertility, risking to violate the exclusion
restriction.%
}. This already indicated that the tradeoff between the time lost by
the mother because of rearing the children and the time gained by
extra hands was likely to work against agricultural production. Typical
for Uganda is the short amount of time spent on applying inputs. Farmers
in Uganda use very limited amounts of fertilizer and other inputs,
so also the time spent on applying them is short. There is also some
heterogeneity in the time spent on different crops. For instance,
matooke is allocated less time than maize, both for men and for women.
However, there are also differences between the sexes. For instance,
women spend much more time cultivating sweet potatoes, and to a lesser
extent beans, than men. 


\subsubsection*{Production\label{sub:Production}}

We also investigated fertility's effect on production of some of the
most important crops. In particular, we looked at fertility's effect
on the likelihood that a household cultivate each of the five most
important crops. The first row in table \ref{tab:2averages} reports
on the percentage of households that grew each of the crops. Over
50 percent reported growing maize, beans and cassava. We also looked
at the impact on area cultivated, measured in acres. Households on
average allocated about half an acre to maize, while the least space
was reserved for sweet potatoes. We also expressed area cultivated
as a share of total area under cultivation. We found that about 17
percent of total land area was allocated to maize, while only 8 percent
was allocated to sweet potatoes. The next line reports average production
in kilograms at the household level. This may seem low, but this is
because households that reported that they did not produce the crop
were also part of the average. We also divided by household size.
Finally,table \ref{tab:2averages} we reports yields for the five
crops, defined as the amount of each crop harvested per unit of land
(per acre).

We also aggregated the different corps by weighting them by average
prices. We used prices from FoodNet%
\footnote{http://www.foodnet.cgiar.org/%
}. In particular, we averaged prices observed in Kampala's Nakawa market
over the July-to-December period in 2004. Doing so, we found that
the average total value derived from these five crops was about UGX98,500,
which translates to about UGX45,000 per capita%
\footnote{UGX stands for Ugandan Shillings, the national currency. At the time
of the survey, USD1 = UGX1,780.%
}. About 40 percent of the households in their reproductive age did
not cultivate any of these five crops. On average, about 0.69 acres
was allocated to these five crops. The yield per acre was about UGX220,220.


\section*{Results}

This section presents the results of our two-stage least squares estimates
that looked at the causal impact of fertility on various agriculture
related outcomes. The section starts by presenting the first stage
regression of our proposed instruments on the fertility gap. It then
gives a detailed description of the second stage regression that focuses
on fertility's effect on agricultural labor supply. This section also
explores fertility's effect on area planted, production, and productivity.


\subsubsection*{The first stage regression}

Table \ref{tab:firststage} reports the results for the first stage
regression, which linked the sex of first child/children to fertility.
The dependent variable, as explained above, was the difference between
the maximum number of children of a typical woman at her age and the
actual number of children the women bore%
\footnote{The maximum number of children has been estimated from the DHS and
is actually the 95th percentile.%
}. We referred to this as the fertility gap (\emph{fgap}) or fertility
shortfall. This is actually the reverse of fertility, as the bigger
the gap, the lower the number of children in the household in a given
age cohort. Apart from the exogenous variable that was excluded from
the second stage regression elaborated in the next sections, we included
a series of control variables that were clearly exogenous to fertility
in all four specifications of the first stage. The first exogenous
control variable, \emph{femhead,} was a an indicator variable that
took the value of 1 if the household head was female. The second,
\emph{urban}, was an indicator variable that took the value of 1 if
the household resided in an urban area%
\footnote{In some specifications where we expect regional variation in the outcome
variable to be important, such as for production and yields for certain
crops, we also include dummies for the four regions in both the first
and second stage equations. This addition did not significantly change
other estimated parameters in the first stage.%
}. Next, we included three dummies to account for the education level
of the mother. The first, \emph{mprim}, took the value of 1 if the
mother had completed primary education. The second, \emph{msec,} was
the additional effect of having completed secondary education. The
third, \emph{mthird,} was the additional effect of the mother having
completed tertiary education. The comparison category was therefore
households where the mother did not complete at least primary education.
We also added two community variables that were likely to influence
household size. These wew \emph{school }which was a dummy variable
that took the value of 1 if there was a school in the village, and
\emph{health,} which was a dummy that took the value of 1 if there
was a public health center or clinic in the community. Finally, we
also added an indicator (\emph{cdied}) that took the value of one
if a son or daughter of the mother had died in the past.

We experimented with 4 different possible excluded instruments. Model
(1) used an indicator that took the value of 1 if the firstborn in
the household was a girl as an excluded instrument (\emph{oldestgirl}).
The coefficient was significant at the 1 percent level and had the
expected sign. Having a girl as the firstborn offspring reduced the
fertility gap by about 0.2 children. In other words, households that
had a girl as a firstborn tended to be closer to maximal fecundity.
For the controls, we found that households where females were the
head had a significantly larger fertility gap. The effect was very
large, suggesting that such mothers had more than 1 child less than
the maximum. Also, in urban areas, households seemed to have significantly
fewer children. Schooling of the mother seemed to reduce the number
of children only at the secondary and tertiary level. There seemed
to be some indication that mothers who had completed primary education
had a slightly smaller fertility gap than mothers who had not completed
even primary education. The community variables did not seem to have
an effect on the fertility gap. Finally, having lost a child in the
past left a significant additional fertility gap compared with households
that had never lost a child. However, the additional gap was much
lower than 1, suggesting a substantial replacement effect in Ugandan
fertility. 

Model (2) used an indicator that equaled 1 if the first two children
born to the mother in the household were both girls as excluded instrument
(\emph{2oldestgirls}). Using this instrument only made sense if we
confined ourselves to households that had at least two children, hence
the reduction in the sample size. As in (1) the parameter on the excluded
instrument was significantly negative, in line with our hypothesis.
The control variables were very close to what they had been in model
(1). Model (3) went one step further and considered the first three
children. In this case, the indicator, \emph{3oldestgirls} was one
only if the 3 first children were all girls. This again only made
sense for households that had at least three children, further reducing
the sample size. The coefficient estimate was again negative, but
this time it was not significant anymore. We assumed that the reduced
sample size in this model might have reduced the power of the t-test
too much.

Model (4) used a continuous variable as an excluded instrument (\emph{percentfemales}).
We calculated the share of girls among children as a share of the
total number of children in the household. Again, the coefficient
on this instrument had the expected sign. A higher share of females
within the households was associated with a smaller fertility gap.
This was consistent with \citet{Jayachandran01082011}, who observed
that the ``try until you have a boy'' fertility rule leads to an
outcome where larger households have on average more girls. Again,
the other variables were similar to the previous models. We found
that a daughters-only household (\emph{percentfemales} = 1) would
be on average 0.28 children larger than a sons-only household (\emph{percentfemales}
= 0).

While most of our instruments were significant and had the expected
sign, they explained only a small part of the variance in the outcome.
When all exogenous controls were included, the R-squared was indeed
rather low. If we ran partial regressions, regressing the excluded
instruments one by one on the dependent variable, the R-square dropped
below 1 percent. The F-value of a regression with only excluded instruments
- another important indicator of the strength of the instruments according
to \citet{1995} - also dropped to 9.46%
\footnote{As a rule of thumb, it is often stated that one has weak instruments
if this F-statistic is smaller than 10.%
}. In other words, we had serious concerns that our instruments were
weak. We therefore used inference that was robust to weak instruments.
In particular, we relied on the Anderson-Rubin test statistic to gauge
the significance of the endogenous variable in all subsequent regressions
\citep{RePEc:ecm:emetrp:v:65:y:1997:i:3:p:557-586}. 


\subsubsection*{Household labor supply}

This section turns to fertility's effect on total household adult
labor supply (table \ref{tab:totlabour}). It also looks at labor
supply separately for the mother and the father (table \ref{tab:2SLS-estimates-of}),
and by activity (table \ref{tab:2SLS-estimates-allocation}). 

Table \ref{tab:totlabour} investigates the effect of our main variable
of interest, the fertility shortfall, on the number of days worked
in agriculture (land preparation, input application, weeding and harvesting)%
\footnote{We have also done this analysis using days worked per acre of land
held by the household. However, since average land holdings are about
1.1 acre and there seems to be no systematic relationship between
farm size and labor supply, the results were very similar. %
}. The first column of the table reports the result without taking
into account endogeneity of number of children. It reports Ordinary
Least Squares (OLS) estimates that explain the number of days that
adults reported to have worked on the household farm in the 2004 agricultural
season. Agricultural work was defined as work related to land preparation,
input application, weeding and harvesting. We saw that there was no
significant correlation between the number of days worked and fertility
as measured by the fertility gap. We did find significant and negative
effects when the household was being headed by a female (\emph{femhead})
and the household was located in an urban area (\emph{urban}). Primary
and secondary education of mothers (\emph{mprim} and \emph{msec})
did not seem to systematically relate to the number of days worked
in agriculture, but mothers who had finished tertiary education (\emph{mthird})
appeared to work less in agriculture. The OLS estimates also showed
positive correlations between a school in the community (\emph{school})
and days worked in agriculture and between a deceased child in the
past (\emph{cdead}) and days worked by the parents. There is also
some indication of a positive correlation between health centers in
the community (\emph{health}) and days worked by both parents. 

Models (2) to (4) estimated the same models, but instrumented the
fertility gap with a single excluded instrument. In model (2), the
instrument was an indicator taking the value of 1 if the firstborn
was a girl. The coefficient on the fertility gap then became positive
and significant at a 10 percent level, implying that higher fertility
(and hence a shrinking fertility gap) caused a reduction in the number
of days the parents worked on the family fields. Model (3) used the
sex of the first and second born as instruments for the fertility
gap. Model (4) used the share of daughters as an instrument. The estimate
of the fertility effect became higher, and is now significant even
at a 1 percent significance level.

Finally, model (5) used both the gender of the firstborn and the share
of daughters as the excluded instruments%
\footnote{We used Limited Information Maximum Likelihood (LIML), as this is
known to have better small sample properties than 2SLS in overidentified
models with weak instruments \citep{RePEc:aea:jecper:v:15:y:2001:i:4:p:69-85}.%
}. According to the Hansen-J statistic, our model that used multiple
instruments was valid (Hansen-J=0.849; p-val=0.357). We thus assumed
this was the preferred specification. Each additional child caused
a reduction of about 66 days of labor in agriculture by the parents.
With respect to the other variables in the regression, we found some
signs that households where the mother had finished tertiary education
appeared to be less engaged in agriculture.

Table \ref{tab:2SLS-estimates-of} differentiates between work done
by the mother and by the father. For the sake of space, it only shows
the coefficient on the fertility gap, but we also added the exogenous
control variables that were also included in the first stage regression.
Full results can be found in the appendix (table \ref{tab:appendixmotherh}
and table \ref{tab:Effect-on-maileappend}). The top panel in table
\ref{tab:2SLS-estimates-of} shows the effect of fertility on time
worked in agriculture by the mother. The OLS estimate is not significant
(model (1)). Accounting for endogeneity of fertility using the exogenous
variation caused by the sex of the firstborn rendered the fertility
gap significant at a 5 percent level (model (2)). An increase in the
fertility gap per age cohort by one child lead a mother to work almost
30 days more in subsistence farming. Cycling through the results with
the alternative instruments, the results change little with respect
to significance. In all, an additional child seemed to reduce the
number of days the mother worked in agricultural production by about
40 days. Full results are reported in table \ref{tab:appendixmotherh}.

The first column of the second panel reports the same OLS regression
but with the number of days adult males worked as the dependent variable.
As was the case with female labor, the fertility gap did not seem
to correlate to male labor supply when we did not take into account
the endogenous nature of fertility choices. Table \ref{tab:Effect-on-maileappend}
in the appendix gives full results and the OLS results are in the
first column. We found that living in urban areas led to farmers reporting
fewer days worked in the field. In households headed by females, we
also found a large negative effect on the number of days that men
worked in agriculture-related activities. This is because, in most
cases, households are headed by females because the male head is missing,
leading to fewer days reported in the field. We also found some evidence
of males working less if the mother had higher education. This is
most likely because men with higher education choose women with higher
education to marry and the other way around.

Judged by the instrumental variable models from (2) to (5), the effect
of fertility on labor supply by the father was less clear cut. When
we used the sex of the first born (model 2) and the sex of the first
two children born (model 3) as instruments, the coefficient was positive
but not significantly different from zero. If we instrumented the
fertility gap using the percentage of females, we found some indication
that more children might reduce time allocated to working in the field
by the father. The effect, however, is only half the size of the reductions
we found for women. The over-identified model in model (5) showed
a significant effect at the 10 percent level only. These findings
were similar to what others have found. For instance, in their study
on labor supply response to fertility in the United States, \citet{RePEc:aea:aecrev:v:88:y:1998:i:3:p:450-77}
also found that women work less while men did not alter their labor
supply in response to having more children. \citet{RePEc:iza:izadps:dp2162}
found that Indonesian women reduced their working days in response
to the higher fecundity in both rural and urban areas . 

Table \ref{tab:2SLS-estimates-allocation} looks at reported labor
by activity instead of by sex. Again, the results in table \ref{tab:2SLS-estimates-allocation}
only show the coefficients on the fertility gap. Full results are
in the appendix. Model (1) in the top panel presents OLS results for
number of days worked on land preparation. There were no effects from
fertility in this specification. Again, as expected, households living
in urban areas spent significantly less time preparing land. Female-headed
households also allocated less time to land preparation. There was
also some indication that women who had tertiary education were less
engaged in land preparation.

Model (2) presents the same model, but instruments fertility with
the indicator for the first child being a girl. When we ran this model,
the fertility effect became positive, but was not significantly different
from zero. In model (3), which looks at the sex of the first two children,
the fertility gap effect became significant. The effect remained significant
when we instrumented the fertility shortfall by the percentage of
females born (model (4)) and in the over-identified model (5), but
the effect size shrank. An additional child reduced time allocated
to land preparation by about 25 days.

The second panel repeated the same five models, but used days spent
on input application as the dependent variable. In none of the five
specifications did fertility seem to have a significant impact. Overall,
time spent on input application was very limited anyway, as can be
seen in figure \ref{fig:Average-hours-worked}. In all, households
spent only about one day applying inputs (including planting). The
only significant effect we found is that households where the mother
has at least primary education allocated more time to input application
(table \ref{tab:applappend}).

The third panel presents results for time spent on weeding. The results
were similar to the ones for land preparation, but the effects are
smaller. Each extra child reduced time allocated to weeding by about
20 days. Full results in the appendix (table \ref{tab:timeweeding})
show significant negative effects for female-headed households and
for households in urban areas. We also found that households in communities
that have a health center spent fewer days on weeding. Finally, the
last panel looks at the effects of fertility on days worked for harvesting.
There was no significant positive association between the number of
children in the family and the number of days spent harvesting if
we used only our binary instrument. We found a positive effect if
we instrumented the fertility gap by the share of girls among siblings,
but the effect was small compared to the other effects. 

The above suggests that fertility affects time allocated to land preparation
and weeding in a negative way. Harvesting seems to be less related
to family size. Probably, when crops are ready to be harvested, farmers
are more likely to put in the extra effort. This seems to be less
evident for work that has an uncertain payoff in the future, such
as weeding. The reductions of time allocated to land preparation and
weeding may reduce both area planted and agricultural productivity.
The next section looks at this question.


\subsubsection*{Area planted, Production and Productivity}

This section looks at fertility's effect on production and productivity.
It looks at productivity defined as kilograms harvested per acre of
the five most important products separately. It also looks at the
value of total production, the value of production per acre, and the
value of production per capita. 

Table \ref{tab:2SLS-estimates-area} reports on the second stage regressions
of different aspects of production for the five most important crops.
The table only reports the results for the coefficient on the fertility
gap for the instrumental variable regression that uses the share of
girls as excluded instrument. The regressions include the same control
variables as in the previous sections. However, we now also added
regional dummies, as some crops are grown more in some regions than
in others. When the dependent variable was binary or censored, we
estimated a tobit or probit using the methods described in \citet{RePEc:eee:econom:v:36:y:1987:i:3:p:231-250}.

The first row looks at the probability that a household grows the
respective crop. For instance, the first entry in the first row tells
us that the fertility gap did not affect the probability that households
cultivate maize. The third entry, however, shows that households that
had a higher fertility gap were more likely to grow beans. Similarly,
we found that higher fertility significantly reduced the probability
that matooke would be grown. The next row looks at the total area
reported to be used to grow each crop, measured in acres. We found
a positive effect of the fertility gap on the area used to grow matooke.
Fertility seemed to be unrelated to the area used to grow any of the
other crops. However, smaller households that grew more matooke might
simply have had larger land holdings. Therefore, it was useful to
also relate fertility to the share of each crop in total in terms
of land size. This gave an idea of the relative importance of each
crop within the household. This is presented in the next row. In this
case, it seems that households with more children allocated less land
as a share of total land to sweet potatoes. The next row looks at
the value of production in kilograms. Only for matooke, larger households
seemed to obtain a significantly lower quantity of matooke. The next
row looks at production per capita. The lower production of matooke
persisted if we accounted for household size. Finally, the fertility
gap had no significant effect on yield for any of the products.

Finally, table \ref{tab:2SLS-totals} presents results for total production
and productivity, using the prices for the different crops. Again
we used five different models. The first one was again a regression
that did not take endogeneity into account. While in the previous
regressions this was typically OLS, this might now have changed to
a probit or tobit regression, depending on the nature of the dependent
variable. The second regression instrumented the fertility gap with
the sex of the firstborn. The third model used the sex of the first
two children born to the mother and the fourth used the share of girls
among the children. As before, the fourth model instrumented the fertility
difference by two instruments: the sex of the firstborn and the share
of girls among the children.

The first row gives results for the change in production. There seemed
to be no detectable effect from fertility on the total value of the
production of the five crops. The second row expresses this production
in per capita terms. The OLS estimates showed a positive effect of
an increase in the fertility gap. However, if we confined ourselves
to the exogenous part of fertility in the IV regressions, the effect
disappeared. The next row looks at a change in the total area allocated
to the five crops. It showed again no significant effect from fertility.
The final row, which looked at productivity defined as the total value
of the five crops divided by the total area allocated to these five
crops, also showed no causal impact from family size.


\section*{Conclusion}

We looked at the effect of fertility, defined as the number of biological
children born to a mother, on agricultural production and its determinants.
One of the most evident determinants was household agricultural labor.
The identification strategy we used relies on the premise that, in
partilineal societies, boys are preferred to girls in terms of offspring.
Households that have a girl as the first child will have a higher
propensity to add more children to the household. The fact that the
sex of the first child is exogenous can be used to identify the causal
impact of additional children on other variables such as labor supply
and productivity. Similarly, the fertility rule whereby one is more
likely to stop having children after a boy means that, on average,
larger households consist of more girls. Therefore, the share of females
in the total number of children can also be used as an instrument.

Our first stage regression performed reasonably well. We found a significant
negative effect of an indicator variable that the firstborn was a
girl on a variable that measures the shortfall from fecundity. We
equally found a negative effect of an indicator that the first two
children were female. Finally, we also found that households with
a relatively higher share of girls were negatively related to the
fertility gap. While our instruments were significant and had the
correct sign, explanatory power as measured by the partial R-squared
was low. We therefore used inference methods in the second stage that
were robust to weak instruments.

In the second stage regression, we found that fertility affects the
time both women and men allocated to agricultural production. However,
most of the labor time lost as a consequence of an exogenous increase
in children was borne by the woman. Land preparation and weeding,
especially, were activities that seemed to suffer from excessive fertility.
When we looked at crops, we found that only matooke and sweet potatoes
were significantly affected by fertility. 

Matooke is the most important stable crop in Uganda, providing 18
percent of caloric intake \citep{RePEc:ags:midcwp:58553}. The finding
that young households that have higher fertility were reducing the
most important source of calories suggests that higher fertility also
causes under-nutrition. Sweet potatoes are also a typical food security
crop, with a low return but also low risk \citep{RePEc:ucp:ecdecc:v:44:y:1996:i:3:p:485-513}.
It is also a crop that is mostly under the control of the women, who
do much of the work on the field. 

That said, the fact that we relied on a cross-section of households
also limits extent to which our conclusions can be generalized. It
may well be that couples that have more children profit much more
from larger household size at a later stage in life. For instance,
in households where the mother has reduced fertility, she may have
more time to work in agricultural activities. In addition, children
may provide cheap and flexible labor at a later age. Therefore, we
want to stress that our results only hold for the subset of ``young''
households, where the woman is between 16 and 32.

There are different ways in which the negative effect of fertility
on labor and production can be influenced. First, our analysis reconfirms
the need for fertility-reducing policies. Apart from known fertility-reducing
policies such as women's education and improved maternal health care,
the most promising policies should try to work on the root cause of
increased fertility. This should be done by reducing households' propensity
to have higher fertility if the firstborn is a girl. We can think
of a host of policies that would do this by pushing against the patrilineal
nature of these societies. For example, Uganda may consider changing
its land act to make it similar to what Kenya recently did and give
equal inheritance rights to both girls and boys. 

Policy response involves addressing cultural issues related to high
fertility, some of which may face considerable resistance. Changing
a set of cultural values is likely to be a very slow process. Meanwhile,
the government of Uganda should support the nutritional needs of young
families. It should also consider introducing agricultural technologies
that save on agricultural labor, especially for women.\newpage{}

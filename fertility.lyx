\begin_layout Title
Fertility, Household Labor Supply and Agricultural Production: Instrumental
 Variable Evidence from Uganda
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Bjorn Van Campenhout
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Fertility is likely to affect agricultural production through its effect
 on household labor supply.
 However, to uncover the causal effect of fertility on agricultural labour
 and production, one needs to deal with the fact that the household size
 is a choice variable within the household that is determined simultaneously
 with labour and production decisions.
 Using the fact that in traditional, patriarchal societies sons are preferred
 to girls, we isolate exogenous variation in the number of children born
 to the mother and related it to labor supply and production outcomes in
 Uganda, a country that combines a dominant agricultural sector with one
 of the largest fertility rates in the world.
 We find that fertility significantly reduces the time women spend on agricultur
al activities.
 Especially land preparation and weeding seem to suffer when time needs
 to be reseved to care for additional children.
 We find that total production also reduces with more children, as does
 land area cultivated, while there is no impact on average productivity.
 Thus, high fertility means mothers have less time to work on the field,
 which means less area cultivated and lower productivity at the household
 level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the most basic level, subsistence farmers in rural Africa combine natural
 with human resources to make a living.
 They use mainly household labor on their own small plots to produce for
 own production.
 As such, the quantity of family labor available is an important determinant
 of well-being.
 Family labor availability, generally believed to suffer much less from
 moral hazard problems, will be a direct function of the number of biological
 children within the household.
 For instance, more children means more hands to work on the field.
 At the same time, more children means mothers, and to a lesser extend siblings
 and fathers, will need to spend more time on reproductive chores meaning
 less time will be available to spend on agricultural activities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Uganda has one of the highest fertility rates in the world and a substantial
 part of the population lives in rural areas making a living out of semi-subsist
ence agriculture.
 Even in the light of substantial reductions in child mortality rates, total
 fertility rates remain stubbornly high.
 On average, Ugandan women in rural areas bear 6.8 children over the course
 of their reproductive lives

.
 The question on how fertility affects well-being through its effect on
 household labour supply and agricultural production is therefore very important.
 For example, knowledge on how fertility affects time allocation by different
 cattegories within the household is important to gender-stream efforts
 related to crop intensification and commercialization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we will investigate the effect of fertility on agricultural
 production at the household level.
 In particular, we will look at the effect of the number of biological children
 on household member labor input, as well as a range of productivity measures
 for different crops.
 However, fertility is a choice variable to agricultural households.
 For instance, mothers who work long hours in the field may try to avoid
 becoming pregnant because this would only increase hardship.
 Or, households with low agricultural production may deliberately choose
 to have more children because this means cheap labor.
 If fertility, time allocations and agricultural production is indeed jointly
 determined, just looking at correlations will be misleading, and one needs
 to find a way to seperate the exogenous varation from the part that is
 jointly determined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our identification strategy is a simple but powerful instrumental variables
 approach inspired by the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "RePEc:aea:aecrev:v:88:y:1998:i:3:p:450-77"

\end_inset

.
 We use the fact that male offsprings are preferred in conservative, patriarchal
 societies to construct a range of instruments.
 The exogenous variation in the sex of a child can then be used to determine
 the exogenous component of household size.
 Such a two stage least squares approach is expected to yield consistent
 estimates for the causal effect of fertility on agricultural labor supply
 and associated agricultural production within the household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our findings suggest that, while simple correlations suggest a positive
 relationship, high fertility rates cause women to work significantly less
 on the family farm.
 Labor supply of men and children is unaffected by family size.
 Especially time allocated to weeding and land preparation are negatively
 affected by more biological children.
 We find no significantly productivity effects for most of the crops.
 Only for beans, there high fertility is associated with higher productivity.
 We find no effect on total productivity, as approximated by the value of
 the five most important crops per area cultivated.
 Both household level production and area cultivated are negatively affected
 by fertility.
 Take together, this means that more children lead households to reduce
 agriculture production mainly through a reduction in the number of acres
 under cultivation.
 The prime reason for this reduction is that women with more children are
 unable to free time to work on larger plots.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is an active debate among scholars in the field of labour economists
 on the relationship between fertility and labour supply.

 use the fact that American couples prefer children of different sex, and
 and are likely to keep trying if the first two children are of the same
 sex as a source of exogenous variation.
 We will argue that in a developing country context, the sex of the first
 born child makes more sense as an instrument.
 Indeed, this instrumentation strategy has been used in such a context.

 use the sex of the first two children to predict exogenous fertility in
 India.
 However, we feel it is too ambitious to relate fertility directly to poverty
 and related measures of consumption as there may be ways in which the instrumen
t can affect cosnumption besides through the fertility chanel.
 We therefore restrict ourselves to labour allocation and production.
 In addition, most studies that look at the effects of fertility on labour
 allocation are on data from Asia.
 Well documented high incidence of selective abortion in these areas means
 the sex of the first child or children becomes endogenous as well.
 This is likely to be much less of a problem in our application, which is
 to our knowledge the first such application to an African country.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This article is organized as follows.
 The next section gives a brief overview of the most prominent papers that
 are related to the present paper.
 Then, we make our case for the use of the sex of the first-born as an instrumen
t.
 We then present the data on which we will rely, and describe our main variables
 we will use in the analysis.
 We then present the results.
 In this section, we first take a close look at the first stage regression.
 We then look at the effect of fertility on household labor supply, considering
 differential effects depending on household demographics as well as agricultura
l labor activities.
 We then turn to the effect of household size on productivity.
 A final section concludes.

 country context.
 They note the contradiction between widely held views that larger households
 are often poorer (due to increased competition for a given food stock)
 and scale economies in consumption.
 The find that, if economies of scale are accounted for within households,
 the negative correlation between household size and consumption expenditure
 disappears.
 On the production side of the farm household, the effect of household size
 is equally ambiguous.
 Some may argue that larger households means that more labor is available
 within the household.
 The additional advantage of this labor is that it is not subject to the
 moral hazard effects often attributed to hired labor

 But at the same time, more dependents within the household means more time
 needs to be allocated to reproductive activities.
 Also, agricultural labour and agricultural production may be subject to
 diminishing returns.
 In this study, we will start by investigating the link between fertility
 and agricultural labour supply and then look at the relation between fertility
 and agricultural production respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relationship between fertility and household labor supply has been studied
 most carefully in the field of labor economics.
 Since this literature is so extensive, we only mention two of the most
 influential works here.
 The first is 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:aea:aecrev:v:88:y:1998:i:3:p:450-77"

\end_inset

, who attempt to quantify the effect of fertility on labor supply in the
 US.
 They deal with the endogeneity of the number of children women have by
 exploiting the fact that Americans tend to prefer mixed sibling-sex in
 their household.
 They argue that parents of same-sex siblings are significantly and substantiall
y more likely to go on to have an additional child.
 They find that more children does indeed reduce labor force participation
 of women, but the effect is less pronounced than previous studies suggested.
 They find no effect on the labour supply of the father.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another paper that tries to answer the same question is 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:ucp:jpolec:v:88:y:1980:i:2:p:328-48"

\end_inset

.
 In this paper, the exogenous variation in the number of children is obtained
 by using the occurrence of multiple births (twins) at first birth as an
 instrument.
 The authors argue that the comparison between women who gave birth to a
 single child at first birth and women who gave birth to twins at first
 birth teases out the causal effect of related to an extra child.
 Since the occurrence of twins is exogenous, there is no danger that heterogenei
ty in women preferences contaminates the estimated coefficients.
 The study finds that household size reduces female labor supply, but the
 effect is only temporary

 use sex of the first two children as a natural experiment and find that
 household size has a positive effect on poverty in India.
 They use essentially the same argument as we will make in the next section.
 Our study, however, is are less ambitious.
 We feel that there are too many pathways through which household size can
 influence poverty to be useful.
 In addition, welfare, and the related concept of poverty, relies on consumption
 per capita.
 Consumption per capita as the independent variable is likely to be problematic
 in the two stage least squares setting.
 There is a real danger that the instrumental variable affects the outcome
 variable directly, instead of only through its influence in family size.
 For instance, if boys consume on average more than girls, the exclusion
 restriction is violated.
 They confirm that high fertility is correlated with poverty, but the correlatio
n dissapears when they account for potential endogeneity of fertility.
 There is also some evidence on Indonesia.

 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, fertility is related to the allocation of labour within households.
 However, they move away from the direct instrumental variable approach
 that is standard and instead estimate a reproduction function taking into
 account endogenous contraceptive choice.

All the above studies employ data from South East Asia.
 It is well-known that fertility at birth is already skewed in many Asian
 countries.
 For instance India, from which

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This suggests a relationship between the instrument and the error term
 of the structural equation.
 It is well know that, in the context of weak instruments, such correlation
 can seriously bias estimates 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The likely negative correlation between the instrument and the error term
 will mean that, in this case,

's estimates are biased downward, in the direction of their original OLS
 estimate.
 This bias is likely to be much less pronounced in our data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our paper, we will try to address some of the above challenges.
 We will use the sex of the first-born and variations thereof as our instrumenta
l variables.
 We will relate fertility to agricultural labour supply and agricultural
 production, since there is a direct link between these three variables.
 We will also concentrate on Africa.
 Here, while there is a boy preference, reproduction rate norms are high
 and the cost of raising children is low.
 This means that selective abortion is much less of a concern.
 Still, we rely on the sex and numbers of children within the family, meaning
 that the kind of sex preference as described in

However, at a more basic level, boy preference is already revealed by parents
 who, if asked in for example surveys, state clearly that they want to have
 more boys than girls.
 Such preferences lead to a particular decision rule with respect to fertility,
 where the likelihood that children are added to the household is positively
 correlated to the number of surviving girls in the household.
 The preference for a boy over a girl results in what

 This underlying consequence of sex bias my partly explain a range of outcomes
 observed in the area of health, mortality and possibly even educational
 attainment.
 Their model shows that even when parents want both boys and girls to have
 the same health and education, disparities can arise passively because
 of fertility preferences.
 They show that a

The use of the sex of first born as an instrument is motivated by various
 cultural and economic factors documented in the anthropological and demographic
 literature.
 In countries where no old age insurance is available, parents may choose
 to invest more in children that have a higher chance of being able to support
 them at old age

 Anthropological and demographic evidence emphasize the dominant role of
 males in traditional patrilineal societies where descent and inheritance
 are transmitted through the male line.
 Furthermore, male children strengthen the relationship between the wife
 and her husband's kin (by guaranteeing the continuation of his lineage)
 and secure (the mother's) access to residence and inheritance upon the
 husband's death.
 Also, the practice of dowry implies that a daughter is often associated
 with an expected expenditure, a central part in the theoretical model of
 son preference in

 reduced childbearing at higher parities, in addition to the mixed-child
 preference.
 As such, we feel that the sex of the first-born (or closely related indicators)
 provide a valid instrument for fertility at the household level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Data and Descriptive Statistics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will use the Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS) 2005/06.
 While being somewhat dated, we have chosen this survey because it has much
 more information on agriculture than the more recent UNHS of 2009/10.
 Structured with a standard Living Standard Measurement Survey - Integrated
 Survey on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) in mind, the UNHS 2005/06 collected detailed
 information on a sample of almost 43000 people in 7500 households in Uganda.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ideally, we would like to have a sample of households where all desired
 children where born.
 A household that currently has one child may be in the process of adding
 more children to their family.
 Assume a couple that has just formed and is entering their reproductive
 stage.
 Assume further that the first child is a girl.
 In our sample, this household will show up with a smaller than average
 size, but with a girl as the firstborn, hence this may mistakenly be interprete
d as running against our hypothesis that households prefer boys.
 If the first child is a boy, this same household would show up in our sample
 as smaller than average, and thus this may lead us to put too much confidence
 in our hypothesis.
 The fact that we are working with a cross section of households rather
 than historical data on all births by women that have reached the end of
 their reproductive lives is also reflected in the average number of children.
 This is only 3.13 children, while women bear almost 7 children over their
 entire reproductive period.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To deal with this problem, we work with the difference in the actual number
 of children reported and the maximum reproductive capacity for a woman
 at a certain age, rather than simply the number of children in the household.
 We will refer to this measure of fertility as the gap or shortfall in fertility.
 To get the latter, we would need to estimate the average age at menarche
 within the population, and then simply divide into age the pregnancy period
 plus post pregnancy lactation in-fecund period.
 In addition, one would also need to corporate the maternal mortality ratio
 for "censoring" women's lives who have too many children and thus increasing
 her mortality rate (and exit from the sample).
 However, we took the 95th precental of total fertility rates per age from
 the Demographic and Health Survey of Uganda (2011).
 This is probably a good approximation of the upper bound by age of fertility
 in the population.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The selection of children is base on the household roster.
 In particular, we will select individuals that respond they are son or
 daughter of the household head.
 There is a potential problem when using a cross sectional survey such as
 the UNHS that only looks at reported dependents currently living within
 the household to calculate the difference between actual and theoretical
 fertility.
 Older women may be living in households where some of the older children
 have already left the household.
 Thus, at around the age of thirty, the gap between reported children in
 the household and theoretical fertility starts to increase more rapidly
 because of children growing old enough to start household of their own.
 More troubling, the reported gender of the oldest son or daughter living
 in the household may not be the gender of first-born.
 To overcome this problem, we restrict our sample to households where the
 mother is between 16 and 32.
 The cut off age of thirty two is because at this age, the first-born of
 the mother will turn 16, which is our entry age into the sample of mothers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at the sex of the first-born is only one possible strategy.
 One may argue that the sex of the first born is not very relevant in a
 context where women bear on average almost 7 children.
 Indeed, it is likely that households will get a second child irrespective
 of the sex of the first

, who find that the difference in breastfeeding duration between boys and
 girls is largest near target family size, when gender is most predictive
 of subsequent fertility.
 Therefore, we will not only use the sex of the firstborn child as an instrument
 for fertility, but also experiment with alternative instruments such as
 an indicator that the first two children are girls or a variable that expresses
 the share of male children in the total family size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Fertility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we will present some descriptive statistics to check if
 boy preference is reflected in fertility patterns in the Ugandan data.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:gender-and-fertility"

\end_inset

 summarizes our findings.
 The first two columns checks if households that have a daughter as first-born
 are more likely to have extra children.
 We simply calculated the percentage of households that had more than one
 child conditional on their first born being a son or a girl.
 We find that in the sub-sample where the first child is a boy, about 37.46
 percent of households will have at least one more child.
 However, if the first child happened to be a girl, almost 40 percent of
 households will have at least one more child.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also look at the shortfall in actural fertility to theoretical fertility.
 In the first two columns, we report this fertility gap for two groups of
 households.
 We find that households that have a boy as the firstborn child have an
 average fertility gap of about 2.46 children.
 Consistent with the proposition that have a firstborn girl are likely to
 have more children conditional on age, we find that the gap is smaller
 then the firstborn is a girl (2.26).
 In other words, households where the firstborn is a girl will be closer
 to the theoretical maximal fertility than those that had a boy as the firstborn.
 The difference in the fertility gap between the group of households with
 a first born boy and a first born girl is significant (p=0.003).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third and fourth column present the same statistics, but now looks the
 sex of the first two children.
 As such, there are three possible scenarios.
 If the first two children are both boys, we expect that the chance that
 they have extra children is lowest.
 We find the probability of adding children in this case to be just over
 13 percent.
 If the first was a girl and the second was also a girl, we expect there
 is a higher chance that parents choose to have extra children.
 In this case, there is an almost 14 percent chance that they add at least
 one child to the household.
 For those that had a first girl but their second child was a boy, we expect
 the probability of increasing household size to lie between the two, which
 is indeed the case.
 The lower panel shows that the gap between actual and potential household
 size is largest when the first two children are boys.
 The gap is smallest when the first two children are both girls.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we compare the average fertility in two different groups defined
 by the share of female children within the total number of children.
 As already stated above, because of boy preference, female children are
 likely to live in larger families.
 We indeed find that if there are more girls than boys amongst the children,
 the average number of children is higher.
 We also find a difference in the fertiliy gap that is significant with
 associated p-value of 0.021.

Hours worked

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we will briefly look at some descriptive statistics on labor
 supply, one of the prime pathways through which fertility affects productivity
 and well-being.
 Most of Uganda has two cropping seasons.
 The first runs from January to June.
 The second cropping season is from July to December.
 The UNHS 2005/06 interviewed households twice over the course of one year
 to capture this feature.
 It visisted households in the beginning of 2005 to capture the second cropping
 season in 2004 (that is, running from July to December 2004).
 Households were revisited at the end on 2005 to record information from
 the first cropping season in 2005 (running from January to June 2005).
 In our study, we will only consider the 2004 cropping season, as data for
 labour allocation to agriculture was unavailable for the 2004 cropping
 season.

The dimensions are mother, father or child; land preparation, input application,

 The crops are the five most grown crops.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 One of the most obvious observations is that women do most of the work,
 and child labor is restricted to about one day per crop and activity during
 the entire season.
 This already indicates that the trade-off between the time lost by the
 mother because of rearing the children and the time gained by extra hands
 is likely to work against agricultural production.
 Typical for Uganda is the low amount of time spent on applying inputs.
 Farmers in Uganda use very limited amounts of fertilizer and other inputs,
 so also the time spend on applying them is small.
 There is also some heterogeneity in the time spend on different crops.
 For instance, matooke requires less time than maize, both for men and for
 women.
 However, there are also difference between the sexes.
 For instance, women spend much more time cultivating sweet potatoes, and
 to a lesser extent beans, than men.

Results

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The first stage regression
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first stage regression results that link sex of first child/children
 to fertility are reported in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:firststage"

\end_inset

.
 The dependent variable is fertility at the household level, approximated
 by the number of children born up to the time of the survey.
 We will also refer to this as family or household size.
 Apart from the exogenous variable that is excluded from the second stage
 regression elaborated in the next paragraphs, we include a series of control
 variables that are clearly exogenous to fertility in all 5 specifications
 of the first stage.
 The first, 
\emph on
agefirstborn
\emph default
, is the age of the first-born.
 As explained above, we do this because our sample consists of households
 that are at various stages in the life-cycle.
 We expect that, the older the firstborn, the more children there will be
 on average in the family.
 The second exogenous control variable, 
\emph on
femhead,
\emph default
 is a an indicator variable that takes the value of 1 if the household head
 is female.
 The third, 
\emph on
urban
\emph default
, is an indicator function that takes the value of 1 if the household resides
 in an urban area
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In some specifications where we expect regional variation in the outcome
 variable to be important, such as for production and yields for certain
 crops, we also include dummies for the four regions in both the first and
 second stage equations.
 This addition did not significantly change other estimated parameters in
 the first stage.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Model (1) uses an indicator that takes the value of one if the firstborn
 in the household is a girl as an excluded instrument.
 The coefficient is significant at the one percent level and has the expected
 sign.
 Having a girl as a first-born increases family size on average by 0.126
 children.
 The controls are all significant and have the expected signs.
 If the firstborn is older, he or she is likely to have more siblings.
 Households where females are the head are smaller.
 This also holds for households that are residing in urban areas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Model (2) uses as excluded instrument an indicator that equals one if the
 first two children born to the mother in the household are both girls.
 Using this instrument only makes sense if we confine ourselves to households
 that have at least two children, hence the substantial reduction in the
 sample size.
 As in (1) the parameter is significantly positive according to expectations.
 Having a girl as a first-born and again a girl as a second-born increases
 family size on average by 0.122 children.
 The control variables are very close to the what they were in model (1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Model (3) uses a continuous variable as excluded instrument.
 We calculated the share of girls among children as a percentage of the
 total number of children in the household.
 Again, the coefficient has the expected sign.
 A higher percentage of females within the households is associated with
 larger family size.
 This is consistent with 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Jayachandran01082011"

\end_inset

, who observe the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

try until you have a boy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 fertility rule leads to an outcome where larger households have on average
 more girls.
 Again, the included instruments are similar to the previous models.
 We find that an all female siblings household will be on average 0.16 larger
 than an all boys siblings household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, model (4) uses multiple excluded instruments.
 In specification (4), we use both the sex of the first-born and the percentage
 of girls in total number of children as instruments.
 The positive effects are also there in specification (4), but the results
 are not significant at conventional levels.
 As in all previous specifications, the exogenous control variables have
 the expected signs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While most of our instruments are significant and have the expected sign,
 they account for only a small part of the variance in the outcome.
 The high R-squared reported is mainly due to the explanatory power of the
 included instruments.
 If we regress the indicator variable of a first girl on household size,
 the R-square drops below 1 percent and the coefficient on the indicator
 is significant only at the 10 percent level.
 The F-value, another important indicator of the strength of the instruments
 according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "1995"

\end_inset

, also drops to 3.18.
 In other words, we have serious concerns that our instruments are weak.
 We therefore use inference that is robust to weak instruments.
 We rely on the Anderson-Rubin test statistic as implemented in the stata
 command weakiv.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Household labor supply
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now turn to look at the effect of fertility on household labor supply.
 We will look at labor supply by three different categories of household
 members (table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:2SLS-estimates-of"

\end_inset

).
 We will also look at labor supply by activity (table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Labour-by-Activity"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:2SLS-estimates-of"

\end_inset

, we investigate the effect of our main variable of interest, the number
 of biological children in the household on the number of days worked in
 agriculture (land preparation, input application, weeding and harvesting)
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We have also done this analysis using days worked per acre of land held
 by the household.
 However, since average land holdings are about 1.1 acre and there seems
 to be no systematic relationship between farm size and labor supply, the
 results are very similar.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We differentiate between work done by the mother, the father and the children.
 We also include control variables that are clearly exogenous to labor supply.
 These are the age of the first-born (
\emph on
agefirst
\emph default
), an indicator if the household is headed by a female (
\emph on
femhead
\emph default
) and an indicator if the household is locate in an urban environment (
\emph on
urban
\emph default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first column of the table reports the result without taking into account
 endogeneity of number of children.
 The top panel of the table reports OLS estimates for the number of days
 the mother reported working in the household.
 We can see that there is a significant positive correlation between the
 number of days worked by the mother and household size.
 The only other variable that seems to matter in this specification is the
 indicator for being located in an urban setting.
 In that case, women work significantly less on in agriculture.
 The constant indicates women spend about 38 labor days working the on the
 field in the July to December 2004 cropping season.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the middle panel, we report the same OLS regression but with the number
 of days worked by adult males as the dependent variable.
 Men spend on average about 33 days on the field in rural areas and 22 days
 if they reside in urban areas.
 Most female household have no or few adult males, working, which should
 be no surprise.
 There seems to be no correlation between household size and time males
 spend in agriculture.

\begin_layout Standard
The last panel looks at the number of days children are reported to be working
 in agriculture.
 As in the case of male members, there is no correlation with fertility.
 There also seems to be no difference between rural and urban areas.
 However, female headed households are associated with lower levels of child
 labor.
 Finally, the OLS estimates suggest life-cycle effects.
 If the age of the firstborn is higher, children are more likely to work
 on the field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Columns (2) to (4) estimate the same models, but instrumenting size with
 a single gender related excluded instrument.
 In column (2), the instrument is an indicator taking the value of one if
 the firstborn is a girl.
 Accounting for endogeneity of fertility using the exogenous variation caused
 by the sex of the firstborn increases the estimate of the average number
 of days worked on the field substantially.
 A woman now reports to be working about 104 days.
 As expected, less time is spent on agriculture in urban areas.
 Female headed households now work significantly less days on the field,
 while more time is invested if the age of the firstborn is higher.
 Most interestingly, we now find that an additional child causes the number
 of days worked on the farm to decrease by almost 50 days.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cycling through the results with the alternative instruments, the results
 change little with respect to significance.
 According to Hansen-J statistic, our model that uses multiple instruments
 is valid.
 We thus assume this is the best specification.
 This specification tells us that women spend on average almost 120 days
 in the field.
 Each additional child causes a reduction of about 60 days.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we instrument fertility in the models for days worked for males in the
 household, average days worked also increases.
 Still, it remains much lower than the average days reported by women.
 Apart from the large female headedness effect, the only other variable
 that seems to matter is the urban indicator, where males spend on average
 significantly less time.
 There is some indication of a negative effect of fertility on male labor
 supply, but it is not significantly different from zero.
 Finally, there is no effect of fertility on child labor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These findings are similar to what others have found.
 For instance, in their study on labour supply response to fertility in
 the United States, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:aea:aecrev:v:88:y:1998:i:3:p:450-77"

\end_inset

 also find that women work less while men do not alter their labour supply
 in response to more children.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:iza:izadps:dp2162"

\end_inset

 find that women reduce their working hours in response to the higher fecundity
 in both rural and urban areas in Indonesia.

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Labour-by-Activity"

\end_inset

 looks at reported labor by activity instead of by sex.
 For instance, model (1) presents OLS results for number of days reported
 to be spending on land preparation.
 On average, the household spends about 29 days preparing land.
 There are no fertility effects.
 Model (2) presents the same model, but instruments fertility with the indicator
 for the first child being a girl.
 This increases the average number of hour worked in the field.
 More importantly, the parameter on fertility now becomes significantly
 negative.
 An extra child reduces time spent on land preparation by more than 30 days.
 The effect is confirmed when we use both percentage of females among the
 children and the sex of the first-born as instruments (model (3)).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Models (4)-(5) run the same respective regressions, but now with time reported
 to input application as the dependent variable.
 The OLS regression indicates households spend less than half a day on this
 activity.
 There seems to be no significant effect of fertility on this activity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Model (7) presents OLS results for time spend on weeding.
 If we do not properly model endogeneity of fertility, more children mean
 more weeding is done.
 Female headed households spend less time on weeding, as do urban households.
 Households spend on average 21 days weeding and each extra child increases
 this by about 2.5 days.
 If we do account for endogeneity of fertility, we find that household size
 actually decreases time allocated to weeding by more than thirty days per
 additional child (model (8)).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, models (10) to (12) investigate the effects of fertility on harvesting.
 According to the ordinary least squares models, there is a significant
 positive association between the number of children in the family and the
 number of days worked on the farm (model (10)).
 The average number of days is about 17 days, lower than time allocated
 to both preparing the land and weeding.
 Each additional child is associated with an extra three days of harvesting.
 However, allowing for endogenity of fertility wipes out the effect (models
 (11) and (12)).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above suggests that family size affects time allocated to land preparation
 and weeding in a negative way.
 It is interesting to note that the endogenity bias is largest for weeding.
 This suggests that households that have many children are likely to allocate
 more time to weeding (they may put, for instance, more children to work
 for weeding).
 However, if we separate out the causal effect that runs from household
 size to weeding, the reverse effect holds.
 Harvesting seems to be less related to family size.
 Probably, when crops are ready to be harvested, farmers are more likely
 to put in the extra effort.
 This seems to be less evident for work that has an uncertain payoff in
 the future.
 The reductions of time allocated to land preparation and weeding are expected
 to reduce agricultural productivity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Productivity and Production
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will now look at the effect of fertility on production and productivity.
 We will look at productivity defined as kilograms harvested per acre of
 the five most important products separately.
 We will also look the value of total production, the value of production
 per acre and the value of production per capita.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "prod"

\end_inset

 reports on the second stage of agricultural productivity for the five most
 important crops.
 Models (1) and (2) report OLS and 2SLS estimates for the amount of kilograms
 maize reportedly harvested per acre of cultivated land.
 We find that, on average, households harvest about 614 kilograms per acre.
 Younger households are associated with significantly higher yields, as
 are male headed households.
 The OLS model suggests that household size increases maize productivity.
 However, when endogeneity is taken into account, this positive effect disappear
s.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beans productivity is much lower, as expected, averaging just under 200
 kilograms per acre.
 There also seems to be a positive relationship between household size and
 the productivity of beans.
 The instrumental variable approach now confirms that there is a positive
 effect of additional children on the productivity.
 However, productivity reduces when the age of the firstborn is higher.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Productivity of sweet potatoes is somewhere between 500 and 600 kilograms
 per hectare.
 As for maize, not taking into account the potential endogeneity of fertility
 results in a positive correlation.
 Instrumenting size by the gender of the first-born renders this effect
 insignificant.
 For cassava and matooke, none of the variables are significant apart from
 the constants.
 Cassava yields are around 500 kilograms per acre.
 Matooke yields are about 700 kilograms per acre.

Finally, in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:total-production-and"

\end_inset

 we multiply quantities harvested by average prices and sum over the five
 most important crops.
 This gives us an idea of the value of total production.
 In model (1) we concentrate on the effect of fertility on total production
 at the farm household level in thousands of Ugandan shillings.
 We see that, for this OLS regression, households with more children produce
 more on average.
 Female headed households produce significantly less.
 Households produce crops worth about UGX160000 during entire the agricultural
 season.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The situation changes dramatically when we treat fertility as endogenous
 (model (2)).
 In this case, our estimates suggest that large households produce significantly
 less.
 There is also evidence of a life cycle effect, as production increases
 as the age of the firstborn increases.
 Female headed households appear to do worse, on average, compared to male
 headed households.
 The average output is now worth about UGX420000, but to estimate is much
 less precise.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we turn to total area that has been cultivated by these crops.
 We again present results using plain OLS (model (3)) and 2SLS (model (4)).
 Results show the same pattern as the first two models.
 If we do not account for endogeneity of fertility, there is a correlation
 between larger households and more area cultivated.
 However, if we only consider the exogenous variation within the number
 of children, we find that households with more children actually cultivate
 less land.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last two columns look at the results for productivity, defined as thousands
 of Ugandan shillings per harvested acre.
 Again, one would be inclined to think high fertility is actually good for
 crop intensification.
 However, when we account for potential endogeneity of fertility, we find
 no effect between productivity and the number of children born to the mother
 within the household\SpecialChar \@.

\begin_layout Section*
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we look at the effect of fertility on agricultural productivity
 and its determinants.
 One of the most evident determinants is household agricultural labour.
 More children means more labour is available within the household.
 However, more children also means that time of the most productive persons
 within the family farm, adult females, is lost to reproductive choires.
 In this paper, we try to isolate the causal effect of extra children on
 household labour supply and production.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find evidence that an increase in fertility causes women to work significantl
y less in family agricultre.
 We also find that family size affects time allocated to land preparation
 and weeding in a negative way.
 It is interesting to note that the endogenity bias is largest for weeding.
 This suggests that households that have many children are likely to allocate
 more time to weeding (they may put, for instance, more children to work
 for weeding).
 However, if we separate out the causal effect that runs from household
 size to weeding, the reverse effect holds.
 A policy based merely on correlations would therefore advise to increase
 productivity if the aim is to increase time allocated to weeding.
 However, in reality, the reverse should be recommended.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at productivity of individual crops, we found a positive correlation
 between household size and maize, beans and sweet potato productivity respectiv
ely.
 Only for one crop, beans, this positive correlation seemed to be causal
 as well.
 Apparently, each extra child induces the household to become more productive
 in the production of beans.
 This suggests that household members, most likely mothers, try to compensate
 for their lost time due to child bearing by intensification of beans production
, which is one of the crops with the highest nutritional value amongst the
 five crops.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is no effect on total productivity.
 At the same time, there is a reduction in household level production to
 increased fertility.
 This suggests that households with additional children, due to a lack of
 time, reduce the area they are cultivating.
 This is confirmed by model (4) in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:total-production-and"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This suggests that reducing fertility as a policy in itself is unlikely
 to provide a sustainable path out of poverty.
 Households that increase production through area expansion (as opposed
 to increases in yields) are likely to stay vulnerable to shocks.
 Still, reducing fertility makes more food available at the family level.

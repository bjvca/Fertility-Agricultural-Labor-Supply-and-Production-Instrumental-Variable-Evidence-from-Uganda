\begin_layout Title
Fertility and Agriculture Production: Instrumental Variable Evidence from
 Uganda

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the most basic level, subsistance farmers in rural Africa combine natural
 with human resources to make a living.
 They use mainly household labour on their own small plots to produce for
 own production.
 As such, the quantity of family labour available is an important determinant
 of well-being

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In poor, agricultural based societies, at least part of the correlation
 between household size and well-being works through agricultural productivity.
 For instance, larger households may mean more cheap labour is available
 that does not suffer from moral hazard problems of hired labour.
 But higher fertility may also mean that women have less time to devote
 to agricultural production.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Uganda has one of the highest fertility rates in the world and a substantial
 part of the population lives in rural areas making a living out of semi-subsist
ance agriculture.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we will investigate the effect of fertility on agricultural
 production at the household level.
 In particular, we will look at the effect of the number of biological children
 on household member labour input, as well as a range of productivity measures
 for different crops.
 Our identification strategy is a simple but powerful instrumetal variables
 approach inspired by the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "RePEc:aea:aecrev:v:88:y:1998:i:3:p:450-77"

\end_inset

.
 We use the fact that male ofsprings are prefered in conservative patriarchal
 societies to construct a range of instruments.
 The exogenous variation in the sex of a child can then be used to determine
 the exogenous component of household size.
 Such a two stage least squares approach is expected to yield consistent
 estimates for the causal effect of fertility on agricultural production
 within the household.

 focus more on the consumption side effects of household size in a developing
 country context.
 They note the contradiction between widely held views that larger households
 are often poorer and scale economies in consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the production side of the farm household, the effect of household size
 is equally ambiguous.
 Some authors point out that larger households means that more labour is
 available within the household.
 The additional advantage of this labour is that it is not subject to the
 moral hazard effects often attributed to hired labour

The relationship between fertility and household labour supply has been
 studied most carefully in the field of labour economics.
 Since this literature is so extensive, we only mention two of the most
 influential works here.
 The first is 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:aea:aecrev:v:88:y:1998:i:3:p:450-77"

\end_inset

 that tries to quantify the effect of fertility on female labour supply
 in the US.
 They deal with the endogeneity of the number of children women have by
 exploiting the fact that Americans tend to prefer mixed sibling-sex in
 their household.
 They argue that parents of same-sex siblings are significantly and substantiall
y more likely to go on to have an additional child.
 They find that more children does indeed reduce labour force pariticipation
 of women, but the effect is less pronounced than previous studies suggested.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another paper that tries to answer the same question is 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:ucp:jpolec:v:88:y:1980:i:2:p:328-48"

\end_inset

.
 In this paper, the exogenous variation in the number of children is obtained
 by using the occurence of multiple births (twins) at first birth as an
 instrument.
 The authors argue that the comparison between women who gave birth to a
 single child at first birth and women who gave birth to twins at first
 birth teases out the causal effect of related to an extra child.
 Since the occurence of twins is exogenous, there is no danger that heterogenity
 in women preferences contaminates the estimated coefficients.
 The study finds that household size reduces female labour supply, but the
 effect is only temporary

Data and Descriptive Statistics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will be using the Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS) 2005/06.
 While being somewhat dated, we have chosen this survey because it has much
 more information on agriculture than the more recent UNHS of 2009/10.
 Structured with a standard Living Standard Measurement Survey - Integrated
 Survey on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) in mind, the UNHS 2005/06 collected detailed
 information on a sample of almost 43000 people in 7500 households in Uganda.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The selection of children is base on the household roster.
 In particluar, we will select individuals that respond they are son or
 daughter of the household head.
 In Uganda, as in most developing countries, households are often extended,
 encompassing several generations.
 This means that such a strategy may also select adults that are son or
 daughter, but never moved out.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From this sample, we select households that are headed by couples that are
 in the reproductive stages or their lives, roughly defined as being between
 the ages of 16 and 60.
 We do this because in the household survey, the relationships are defined
 relative to the household head.
 As such, we 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ideally, we would like to have a sample of households where all desired
 children where born.
 A household that currently has one child may be in the process of adding
 more children to their family.
 If the first child is a girl, this may mistakenly be interpreted as running
 against our hypothesis that households prefer boys.
 If the first child is a boy, this may lead us to put too much confidence
 in our hypothesis.
 We will investigate the robustness of our results using different strategies.
 First, we will control for the age of the parents (or the age of the first
 born) in the first stage regression.
 Secondly, we will run our regressions using different subsets of the sample,
 for instance selecting only parents that are nearing the end of their reproduct
ive period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at the sex of the fist-born is only one possible strategy.
 One may argue that the sex of the first born is not very relevant in a
 context where women bear on average about 6 children.
 Indeed, it is likely that households will get a second child irrespective
 of the sex of the first.
 The story may be different in a household that has already 6 children who
 happen to be all girls.
 Therefore, we will not only use the sex of the firstborn child as an instrument
 for fertility, but also experiment with alternative instruments such as
 an indicator that the first three children are girls or a variable that
 expresses the share of male children in the total.

In developed countries, there is a preference for a mix of sexes among children.
\end_layout

.
 Most of the literature, however confirms this boy preference in Asian countries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of the sex of first born as an instrument as opposed to sex-mix
 in other studies is motivated by cultural differences between African countries
 and Western countries.

Most of Uganda has two cropping seasons.
 The first runs from January to June and is by far the most important.
 The second cropping season is from July to December.
 The UNHS 2005/06 interviewed households twice over the course of one year
 to capture this feature.
 It visisted households in the begining of 2005 to caputure the second croping
 season in 2004 (that is, running from July to December 2004).
 Households were revisted at the end on 2005 to record information from
 the first croping season in 2005 (running from January to June 2005).
 In our study, we will only consider the 2005 cropping season.

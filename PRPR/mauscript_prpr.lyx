\begin_layout Title
Fertility, Household Labor Supply and Agricultural Production - Instrumental
 Variable Evidence from Uganda
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Fertility is likely to affect agricultural production through its effect
 on the supply of agricultural labour.
 Using the fact that in traditional, patriarchal societies sons are preferred
 to girls, we isolate exogenous variation in the number of children born
 to the mother and related it to labor supply and production outcomes in
 Uganda, a country that combines a dominant agricultural sector with one
 of the highest fertility rates in the world.
 We find that fertility has a strong negative effect on hours worked by
 the mother in the field.
 We also find some evidence of a negative effect for the father, but the
 size of the effect is only half that of the women.
 There is no effect on child labour.
 Households with lower fertility devote significantly more time to land
 preparation and weeding.
 This results in the fact that larger households grow less matooke and sweet
 potatoes.

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the most basic level, subsistence farmers in rural Africa combine natural
 with human resources to make a living.
 They use mainly household labor on their own small plots to produce for
 own consumption.
 As such, the quantity of family labor available for agriculture is an important
 determinant of well-being.
 Family labor availability, generally believed to suffer much less from
 moral hazard problems, will be a direct function of the number of biological
 children within the household.
 For instance, more children means more hands to work on the field.
 At the same time, more children means mothers, and to a lesser extend siblings
 and fathers, will need to spend more time on reproductive chores, meaning
 less time will be available to spend on agricultural activities.
 Since women are known to supply most of the agricultural labour the loss
 in time needed for reproductive activities potentially offsets the the
 gains from larger families.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Uganda has one of the highest fertility rates in the world and a substantial
 part of the population lives in rural areas making a living out of semi-subsist
ence agriculture.
 Even in the context of large reductions in child mortality rates, total
 fertility rates remain stubbornly high.
 On average, Ugandan women in rural areas bear 6.8 children over the course
 of their reproductive lives

.
 The question on how fertility affects well-being through its effect on
 household labour supply and agricultural production is therefore relevant.
 For example, knowledge on how fertility affects time allocation by different
 categories within the household is important to gender-stream efforts related
 to crop intensification and commercialization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we will investigate the effect of fertility on agricultural
 production at the household level.
 In particular, we will investigate the effect of the number of biological
 children on household member labor input in agriculture (further categorized
 in land preparation, weeding, input application and harvesting).
 We will also look at the effect of fertility on crop portfolio, area cultivated
, production and productivity for the five most important crops.
 However, fertility is a choice variable to agricultural households.
 For instance, mothers who work long hours in the field may try to avoid
 becoming pregnant because this would only increase hardship.
 Or, households with low agricultural production may deliberately choose
 to have more children because this means cheap labor.
 If fertility, time allocations and agricultural production is indeed jointly
 determined, just looking at correlations will be misleading, and one needs
 to find a way to separate the exogenous variation from the part that is
 jointly determined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our identification strategy is a simple but powerful instrumental variables
 approach inspired by the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:aea:aecrev:v:88:y:1998:i:3:p:450-77"

\end_inset

.
 We use the fact that male off-springs are preferred in conservative, patriarcha
l societies to construct a range of instruments.
 The exogenous variation in the sex of a child can then be used to determine
 the exogenous component of household size.
 Such a two stage least squares approach is expected to yield consistent
 estimates for the causal effect of fertility on agricultural labor supply
 and associated agricultural production within the household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is an active debate among scholars in the field of labour economists
 on the relationship between fertility and labour supply.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:aea:aecrev:v:88:y:1998:i:3:p:450-77"

\end_inset

 use the fact that American couples prefer children of different sex, and
 and are likely to keep trying if the first two children are of the same
 sex as a source of exogenous variation.
 We will argue that in a developing country context, the sex of the (first
 born) child makes more sense as an instrument.
 Indeed, this instrumentation strategy has been used in such a context.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 use the sex of the first two children to predict exogenous variation in
 fertility in India and its effect on well-being.
 We feel it is too ambitious to relate fertility directly to poverty and
 related measures of consumption as there may be ways in which the instrument
 can affect consumption besides through the fertility channel.
 We therefore restrict ourselves to labour allocation, area planted and
 production.
 In addition, most studies that look at the effects of fertility on labour
 allocation are on data from Asia.
 Well documented high incidence of selective abortion in these areas means
 the sex of the first child or children becomes endogenous as well.
 This is likely to be much less of a problem in our application, which is
 to our knowledge the first such application to an African country.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We find that the sex of the first-born, the sex of the first two children
 born, as well as the percentage of girls a a share of total children in
 each age cohort all significantly explain observed fertility, measured
 as the gap between actual children born and a theoretical maximal fecundity
 for each age cohort.
 Fertility has a strong negative effect on hours worked by the mother in
 the field.
 We also find some evidence of a negative effect for the father, but the
 size of the effect is only half that of the women.
 There is no effect on child labour.
 Households with lower fertility devote significantly more time to land
 preparation and weeding.
 We also find that smaller households grow and produce more matooke.
 This effect holds to a lesser extent for sweet potatoes.
 We find no impact on yields.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This article is organized as follows.
 The next section gives a brief overview of the most prominent papers that
 are related to the present paper.
 Then, we make our case for the use of the sex of the first-born as an instrumen
t using literature that documents child gender and reproductive behaviour.
 We then present the data we will use in our application, and describe our
 main variables we will use in the analysis.
 Next, we present the results.
 In this section, we first take a close look at the first stage regression.
 We then look at the effect of fertility on household labor supply, considering
 differential effects depending on household demographics as well as agricultura
l labor activities.
 We then turn to the effect of household size on productivity.
 A final section concludes.

 focus more on the consumption side effects of household size in a developing
 country context.
 They note the contradiction between widely held views that larger households
 are often poorer (due to increased competition for a given food stock)
 and scale economies in consumption.
 The find that, if economies of scale are accounted for within households,
 the negative correlation between household size and consumption expenditure
 disappears.
 On the production side of the farm household, the effect of household size
 is equally ambiguous.
 Some may argue that larger households means that more labor is available
 within the household.
 The additional advantage of this labor is that it is not subject to the
 moral hazard effects often attributed to hired labor

 But at the same time, more dependents within the household means more time
 needs to be allocated to reproductive activities.
 Also, agricultural labour and agricultural production may be subject to
 diminishing returns.
 In this study, we will start by investigating the link between fertility
 and agricultural labour supply and then look at the relation between fertility
 and agricultural production respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The relationship between fertility and household labor supply has been studied
 most carefully in the field of labor economics.
 Since this literature is so extensive, we only mention two of the most
 influential works here.
 The first is 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:aea:aecrev:v:88:y:1998:i:3:p:450-77"

\end_inset

, who attempt to quantify the effect of fertility on labor supply in the
 US.
 They deal with the endogeneity of the number of children women have by
 exploiting the fact that Americans tend to prefer mixed sibling-sex in
 their household.
 They argue that parents of same-sex siblings are significantly and substantiall
y more likely to go on to have an additional child.
 They find that more children does indeed reduce labor force participation
 of women, but the effect is less pronounced than previous studies suggested.
 They find no effect on the labour supply of the father.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another paper that tries to answer the same question is 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:ucp:jpolec:v:88:y:1980:i:2:p:328-48"

\end_inset

.
 In this paper, the exogenous variation in the number of children is obtained
 by using the occurrence of multiple births (twins) at first birth as an
 instrument.
 The authors argue that the comparison between women who gave birth to a
 single child at first birth and women who gave birth to twins at first
 birth teases out the causal effect of related to an extra child.
 Since the occurrence of twins is exogenous, there is no danger that heterogenei
ty in women preferences contaminates the estimated coefficients.
 The study finds that household size reduces female labor supply, but the
 effect is only temporary

 use sex of the first two children as a natural experiment and find that
 household size has a positive effect on poverty in India.
 They use essentially the same argument as we will make in the next section.
 Our study, however, is are less ambitious.
 We feel that there are too many pathways through which household size can
 influence poverty to be useful.
 In addition, welfare, and the related concept of poverty, relies on consumption
 per capita.
 Consumption per capita as the independent variable is likely to be problematic
 in the two stage least squares setting.
 There is a real danger that the instrumental variable affects the outcome
 variable directly, instead of only through its influence in family size.
 For instance, if boys consume on average more than girls, the exclusion
 restriction is violated.
 They confirm that high fertility is correlated with poverty, but the correlatio
n disappears when they account for potential endogeneity of fertility.
 There is also some evidence on Indonesia.

 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, fertility is related to the allocation of labour within households.
 However, they move away from the direct instrumental variable approach
 that is standard and instead estimate a reproduction function taking into
 account endogenous contraceptive choice.

All the above studies employ data from South East Asia.
 It is well-known that fertility at birth is already skewed in many Asian
 countries.
 For instance India, from which

 This suggests a relationship between the instrument and the error term
 of the structural equation.
 It is well know that, in the context of weak instruments, such correlation
 can seriously bias estimates 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The likely negative correlation between the instrument and the error term
 will mean that, in this case,

's estimates are biased downward, in the direction of their original OLS
 estimate.
 This bias is likely to be much less pronounced in our data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our paper, we will try to address some of the above challenges.
 We will use the sex of the first-born and variations thereof as our instrumenta
l variables.
 We will relate fertility to agricultural labour supply and agricultural
 production, since there is a direct link between these three variables.
 We will also concentrate on Africa.
 Here, while there is a boy preference, reproduction rate norms are high
 and the cost of raising children is low.
 This means that selective abortion is much less of a concern.
 Still, we rely on the sex and numbers of children within the family, meaning
 that the kind of sex preference as described in

However, at a more basic level, boy preference is already revealed by parents
 who, if asked in for example surveys, state clearly that they want to have
 more boys than girls.
 Such preferences lead to a particular decision rule with respect to fertility,
 where the likelihood that children are added to the household is positively
 correlated to the number of surviving girls in the household.
 The preference for a boy over a girl results in what

 This underlying consequence of sex bias my partly explain a range of outcomes
 observed in the area of health, mortality and possibly even educational

 Their model shows that even when parents want both boys and girls to have

 of fertility preferences.

The use of the sex of first born as an instrument is motivated by various
 cultural and economic factors documented in the anthropological and demographic
 literature.
 In countries where no old age insurance is available, parents may choose

 them at old age

 Anthropological and demographic evidence emphasize the dominant role of
 males in traditional patrilineal societies where descent and inheritance
 are transmitted through the male line.
 Furthermore, male children strengthen the relationship between the wife
 and her husband's kin (by guaranteeing the continuation of his lineage)
 and secure (the mother's) access to residence and inheritance upon the
 husband's death.
 Also, the practice of dowry implies that a daughter is often associated
 with an expected expenditure, a central part in the theoretical model of
 son preference in

 reduced childbearing at higher parities, in addition to the mixed-child
 preference.
 As such, we feel that the sex of the first-born (or closely related indicators)
 provide a valid instrument for fertility at the household level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Data and Descriptive Statistics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will use the Uganda National Household Survey (UNHS) 2005/06.
 While being somewhat dated, we have chosen this survey because it has much
 more information on agriculture than the more recent UNHS of 2009/10.
 Structured with a standard Living Standard Measurement Survey - Integrated
 Survey on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) in mind, the UNHS 2005/06 collected detailed
 information on a sample of almost 43000 people in 7500 households in Uganda.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ideally, we would like to have a sample of households where all desired
 children where born.
 A household that currently has one child may be in the process of adding
 more children to their family.
 Assume a couple that has just formed and is entering their reproductive
 stage.
 Assume further that the first child is a girl.
 In our sample, this household will show up with a smaller than average
 size, but with a girl as the firstborn, hence this may mistakenly be interprete
d as running against our hypothesis that households prefer boys.
 If the first child is a boy, this same household would show up in our sample
 as smaller than average, and thus this may lead us to put too much confidence
 in our hypothesis.
 The fact that we are working with a cross section of households rather
 than historical data on all births by women that have reached the end of
 their reproductive lives is also reflected in the average number of children.
 This is only 3.13 children, while women bear almost 7 children over their
 entire reproductive period.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To deal with this problem, we work with the difference in the actual number
 of children reported and the maximum reproductive capacity for a woman
 at a certain age, rather than simply the number of children in the household
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Alternatively, one could use the number of children within the household
 and control for the age of the mother.
 We have also run the analysis using this strategy and got the same conclusions.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We will refer to this measure of fertility as the gap or shortfall in fertility.
 To get the latter, we would need to estimate the average age at menarche
 within the population, and then simply divide into age the pregnancy period
 plus post pregnancy lactation in-fecund period.
 In addition, one would also need to corporate the maternal mortality ratio
 for "censoring" women's lives who have too many children and thus increasing
 her mortality rate (and exit from the sample).
 However, we took the 95th percentile of total fertility rates per age from
 the Demographic and Health Survey of Uganda (2011).
 This is probably a good approximation of the upper bound by age of fertility
 in the population.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The selection of children is base on the household roster.
 In particular, we will select individuals that respond they are son or
 daughter of the household head.
 There is a potential problem when using a cross sectional survey such as
 the UNHS that only looks at reported dependents currently living within
 the household to calculate the difference between actual and theoretical
 fertility.
 Older women may be living in households where some of the older children
 have already left the household.
 Thus, at around the age of thirty, the gap between reported children in
 the household and theoretical fertility starts to increase more rapidly
 because of children growing old enough to start household of their own.
 More troubling, the reported gender of the oldest son or daughter living
 in the household may not be the gender of first-born.
 To overcome this problem, we restrict our sample to households where the
 mother is between 16 and 32.
 The cut off age of 32 is because at this age, the first-born of the mother
 will turn 16, which is our entry age into the sample of mothers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at the sex of the first-born is only one possible strategy.
 One may argue that the sex of the first born is not very relevant in a
 context where women bear on average almost 7 children.
 Indeed, it is likely that households will get a second child irrespective
 of the sex of the first.
 This is supported by

, who find that the difference in breastfeeding duration between boys and
 girls is largest near target family size, when gender is most predictive
 of subsequent fertility.
 Therefore, we will not only use the sex of the firstborn child as an instrument
 for fertility, but also experiment with alternative instruments such as
 an indicator that the first two children are girls or a variable that expresses
 the share of female children in the total family size.

Fertility
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we will present some descriptive statistics to check if
 boy preference is reflected in fertility patterns in the Ugandan data.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:gender-and-fertility"

\end_inset

 summarizes our findings.
 The first two columns checks if households that have a daughter as first-born
 are more likely to have extra children.
 We simply calculated the percentage of households that had more than one
 child conditional on their first born being a son or a girl.
 We find that in the sub-sample where the first child is a boy, about 37.46
 percent of households will have at least one more child.
 However, if the first child happened to be a girl, almost 40 percent of
 households will have at least one more child.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also look at the shortfall in actual fertility to theoretical fertility.
 In the first two columns, we report this fertility gap for two groups of
 households.
 We find that households that have a boy as the firstborn child have an
 average fertility gap of about 2.46 children.
 Consistent with the proposition that have a firstborn girl are likely to
 have more children conditional on age, we find that the gap is smaller
 then the firstborn is a girl (2.26).
 In other words, households where the firstborn is a girl will be closer
 to the theoretical maximal fertility than those that had a boy as the firstborn.
 The difference in the fertility gap between the group of households with
 a first born boy and a first born girl is significant (p=0.003).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third and fourth column present the same statistics, but now looks the
 sex of the first two children.
 As such, there are three possible scenarios.
 If the first two children are both boys, we expect that the chance that
 they have extra children is lowest.
 We find the probability of adding children in this case to be just over
 13 percent.
 If the first was a girl and the second was also a girl, we expect there
 is a higher chance that parents choose to have extra children.
 In this case, there is an almost 14 percent chance that they add at least
 one child to the household.
 For those that had a first girl but their second child was a boy, we expect
 the probability of increasing household size to lie between the two, which
 is indeed the case.
 The lower panel shows that the gap between actual and potential household
 size is largest when the first two children are boys.
 The gap is smallest when the first two children are both girls.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we compare the average fertility in two different groups defined
 by the share of female children within the total number of children.
 As already stated above, because of boy preference, female children are
 likely to live in larger families.
 We indeed find that if there are more girls than boys amongst the children,
 the average number of children is higher.
 We also find a difference in the fertility gap that is significant with
 associated p-value of 0.021.

Time worked performing agricultural activities
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section we will briefly look at some descriptive statistics on labor
 supply in agriculture, one of the prime pathways through which fertility
 affects productivity and well-being.
 Most of Uganda has two cropping seasons.
 The first runs from January to June.
 The second cropping season is from July to December.
 The UNHS 2005/06 interviewed households twice over the course of one year
 to capture this feature.
 It visited households in the beginning of 2005 to capture the second cropping
 season in 2004 (that is, running from July to December 2004).
 Households were revisited at the end on 2005 to record information from
 the first cropping season in 2005 (running from January to June 2005).
 In our study, we will only consider the 2004 cropping season, as data for
 labour allocation in agriculture was unavailable for the 2004 cropping
 season.

Figure

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The dimensions are mother, father or child; land preparation, input application,
 weeding and harvesting; and crop.
 The crops are the five most grown crops.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 One of the most obvious observations is that women do most of the work,
 and child labor is restricted to about one day per crop and activity during
 the entire season.
 This already indicates that the trade-off between the time lost by the
 mother because of rearing the children and the time gained by extra hands
 is likely to work against agricultural production.
 Typical for Uganda is the low amount of time spent on applying inputs.
 Farmers in Uganda use very limited amounts of fertilizer and other inputs,
 so also the time spend on applying them is small.
 There is also some heterogeneity in the time spend on different crops.
 For instance, matooke requires less time than maize, both for men and for
 women.
 However, there are also difference between the sexes.
 For instance, women spend much more time cultivating sweet potatoes, and
 to a lesser extent beans, than men.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Production
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also investigate the effect of fertility on production of some of the
 most important crops.
 More in particular, we look at the effect of fertility on the likelihood
 that a household cultivates each of the five most important crops.
 The first row in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:2averages"

\end_inset

 reports on the percentage of households that grow each of the crops.
 Over 50 percent report growing maize, beans and cassava.
 We also look at the impact on area cultivated, measured in acres.
 Households on average allocate about half an acre to maize.
 The least space is reserved for sweet potatoes.
 We also express area cultivated as a share of total area under cultivation.
 We find that about 17 percent of total land area is allocated to maize.
 The next line reports average production in kilograms at the household
 level.
 This may seem low, but this because households that report not to produce
 the crop are also part of the average.
 We also divide by household size.
 Finally, we report yields for the five crops, defined as the amount of
 each crop harvested per unit of land (per acre).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also aggregate the different corps by weighing them to average prices.
 We use prices from FoodNet.
 In particular, we average prices observed in Kampala's Nakawa market over
 the July to December 2004 period.
 Doing so, we find that the average total value derived from these five
 crops is about UGX98,500, which translates to about UGX45000 per capita.
 About 40 percent of the households in their reproductive age does not cultivate
 any of these five crops.
 On average, about 0.69 acres is allocated to these five crops.
 The yield per acre is about UGX220,220.

Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The first stage regression
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first stage regression results that link sex of first child/children
 to fertility are reported in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:firststage"

\end_inset

.
 The dependent variable, as explained above, is the difference between the
 maximum number of children of a typical woman at her age and the actual
 number of children born from the mother
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The maximum number of children has been estimated from the DHS and is actually
 the 95th percentile.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 We will refer to this as the fertility gap (
\emph on
fgap
\emph default
) or fertility shortfall.
 It actually is the reverse of fertility, as the higher the gap, the lower
 the number of children in the household in a given age cohort.
 Apart from the exogenous variable that is excluded from the second stage
 regression elaborated in the next paragraphs, we include a series of control
 variables that are clearly exogenous to fertility in all 4 specifications
 of the first stage.
 The first exogenous control variable, 
\emph on
femhead,
\emph default
 is a an indicator variable that takes the value of 1 if the household head
 is female.
 The second, 
\emph on
urban
\emph default
, is an indicator variable that takes the value of 1 if the household resides
 in an urban area
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In some specifications where we expect regional variation in the outcome
 variable to be important, such as for production and yields for certain
 crops, we also include dummies for the four regions in both the first and
 second stage equations.
 This addition did not significantly change other estimated parameters in
 the first stage.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Next, we include three dummies to account for the education level of the
 mother.
 
\emph on
mprim
\emph default
 take the value of 1 if the mother has completed primary eduction.
 
\emph on
msec
\emph default
 is the additional effect of having completed secondary education.
 Thus, if 
\emph on
msecond
\emph default
 is one, 
\emph on
mprim
\emph default
 is also 1.
 
\emph on
mthird
\emph default
 is the additional effect of the mother having completed tertiary education.
 The comparison category are therefore households where the mother did not
 complete at least primary education.
 We also add two community variables which are likely to influence household
 size.
 These are 
\emph on
school 
\emph default
which is a dummy variable that takes the value of one if there is a school
 in the village and 
\emph on
health
\emph default
 is a dummy that takes the value of one if there is a public health centre
 or clinic in the community.
 Finally, we also add an indicator (
\emph on
cdied
\emph default
) that takes the value of one if a son or daughter of the mother has died
 in the past.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We experiment with four different possible excluded instruments.
 Model (1) uses an indicator that takes the value of one if the firstborn
 in the household is a girl as an excluded instrument.
 The coefficient is significant at the one percent level and has the expected
 sign.
 Having a girl as a first-born reduces that fertility gap by about 0.2 children.
 In other words, households that have a girl as a first-born tend to be
 closer to maximal fecundity.
 For the controls, we find that households where females are the head have
 a significantly larger fertility gap.
 The effect is very large, suggesting such mothers have more than 1 child
 less.
 Also in urban areas, households seem to have less children, as a significantly
 larger difference indicates.
 Schooling of the mother seems to reduce the number of children only at
 secondary and tertiary level.
 There seems to be some indication that mothers that completed primary education
 have a slightly smaller fertility gap than mothers that did not even complete
 primary education.
 The community variables do not seem to have an effect on the fertility
 gap.
 Finally, having lost a child in the past leaves a significant additional
 fertility gap compared to households that never lost a child.
 However, the additional gap is much lower than one, suggesting a substantial
 replacement effect in Ugandan fertility.
 The constant indicates that the overall average fertility gap is about
 two children.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Model (2) uses as excluded instrument an indicator that equals one if the
 first two children born to the mother in the household are both girls.
 Using this instrument only makes sense if we confine ourselves to households
 that have at least two children, hence the reduction in the sample size.
 As in (1) the parameter is significantly negative according to expectations.
 The control variables are very close to the what they were in model (1).
 Model (3) goes one step further and considers the first three children.
 In this case, the indicator 
\emph on
thirdoldestgirl
\emph default
 is one only if the three first children are all girls.
 This again only makes sense in households that have at least three children.
 The coefficient estimate is again negative, but this time it is not significant
 anymore.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Model (4) uses a continuous variable as excluded instrument.
 We calculated the share of girls among children as a share of the total
 number of children in the household.
 Again, the coefficient has the expected sign.
 A higher share of females within the households is associated with a lower
 fertility gap.
 This is consistent with 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, who observe the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 fertility rule leads to an outcome where larger households have on average
 more girls.
 Again, the included instruments are similar to the previous models.
 We find that an all female siblings household will be on average 0.28 children
 larger than an all boys siblings household.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While most of our instruments are significant and have the expected sign,
 they account for only a small part of the variance in the outcome.
 Even when other exogenous controls are included, the R-squared is low.
 If we regress the indicator variable of a first girl on the dependent variable,
 the R-square drops below 1 percent.
 The F-value of a regression with only the excluded instrument, another
 important indicator of the strength of the instruments according to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "1995"

\end_inset

, also drops to 9.46

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As a rule of thumb, it is often stated that one has weak instruments if
 this F-statistic is smaller than 10.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In other words, we have serious concerns that our instruments are weak.
 We therefore use inference that is robust to weak instruments.
 In particular, we rely on the Anderson-Rubin test statistic to gauge the
 significance of the endogenous variable in all subsequent regressions

Household labor supply

\begin_layout Standard
We now turn to look at the effect of fertility on total household labor
 supply (table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:totlabour"

\end_inset

).
 We will also look at labor supply separately for the mother, the father
 and the children (table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:2SLS-estimates-of"

\end_inset

).
 We will also look at labor supply by activity (table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

, we investigate the effect of our main variable of interest, the fertility
 shortfall, on the number of days worked in agriculture (land preparation,
 input application, weeding and harvesting)
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We have also done this analysis using days worked per acre of land held
 by the household.
 However, since average land holdings are about 1.1 acre and there seems
 to be no systematic relationship between farm size and labor supply, the
 results are very similar.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The first column of the table reports the result without taking into account
 endogeneity of number of children.
 It reports OLS estimates for the number of days the reported working on
 the household farm, engaging in land preparation, input application, weeding
 and harvesting.
 We see that there is no significant correlation between the number of days
 worked and fertility as measured by the fertility gap.
 We do find significant and negative effects of the household being headed
 by a female and the household being located in an urban area.
 The education of mothers does not seem to be systematically related to
 the number of days worked in agriculture.
 The OLS estimates also show positive correlations between a school in the
 community and days worked in agriculture and between a deceased child in
 the past and days worked.
 There is also some indication of a positive correlation between health
 centers in the community and days worked.
 On average, households report working about 90 labor days on the field
 in the July to December 2004 cropping season.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Models (2) to (4) estimate the same models, but instrument the fertility
 gap with a single gender related excluded instrument.
 In model (2), the instrument is an indicator taking the value of one if
 the firstborn is a girl.
 The coefficient on the fertility gap now becomes positive, but remains
 insignificant.
 Model (3) uses the sex of the first and second born as instruments for
 the fertility gap.
 The size of the fertility effect becomes larger, but still not significantly
 different from zero.
 Model (4) uses the share of daughters as an instrument.
 The estimate is positive and significant, implying that higher fertility
 (and hence a shrinking fertility gap) reduces the number of days worked
 on the field.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, model (5) uses both the gender of the firstborn and the share of
 daughters as instruments
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We use Limited Information Maximum Likelihood (LIML), as this is known to
 have better small sample properties than 2SLS in overidentified models
 with weak instruments

\end_inset

.
 According to Hansen-J statistic, our model that uses multiple instruments
 is valid (Hansen-J=0.849; p-val=0.357).
 We thus assume this is the best specification.
 Each additional child causes a reduction of about 62 days of labour in
 agriculture.
 With respect to the other variables in the regression, we find some signs
 that households with women that have finished tertiary education appear
 to be less engaged in agriculture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:2SLS-estimates-of"

\end_inset

, we differentiate between work done by the mother, the father and the children.
 We only show the coefficient on the fertility gap, but we also added the
 exogenous control variables that were also included in the first stage
 regression.
 Full results can be found in the appendix.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The top panel in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:2SLS-estimates-of"

\end_inset

 shows the effect of fertility on time worked in agriculture by the mother.
 The OLS estimate is not significant (model (1)).
 Accounting for endogeneity of fertility using the exogenous variation caused
 by the sex of the firstborn renders the fertility gap significant at a
 5 percent level (model (2)).
 Mothers work on average more than 50 days in agriculture.
 Cycling through the results with the alternative instruments, the results
 change little with respect to significance.
 In all, an additional child seems to reduce number of days worked by the
 mother in agricultural production by about 40 days.
 Full results are reported in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:appendixmotherh"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the first column of the middle panel, we report the same OLS regression
 but with the number of days worked by adult males as the dependent variable.
 As is the case with female labour, the fertility gap does not seem to be
 correlated to male layout supply.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Effect-on-maileappend"

\end_inset

 in the appendix gives full results.
 The constant is much lower, reflecting that women work more than ten days
 more on the field during the season, on average.
 We find that residing in urban areas leads farmers reporting less days
 worked on the field.
 We also find a large negative effect of female headedness on days worked
 on agriculture related activities by the male.
 This is because in most cases, households are headed by females because
 the male head is missing, leading to less days reported on the field.
 We also find some evidence of males working less if the mother has higher
 eduction.
 This is most likely because higher educated men choose higher educated
 women to marry and the other way around.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Judged by the instrumental variable models from (2) to (5) the effect of
 fertility on labour supply by the father is less clear cut.
 When using the sex of the first born (model 2) and the sex of the first
 two children born (model 3) as instruments, the coefficient is positive
 but not significantly different from zero.
 If we instrument the fertility gap using the percentage of females, we
 find some indication that more children may reduce time allocated to working
 on the field my males.
 The effect, however, is much smaller than the reduction found for women.
 The over-identified model in model (5) shows a significant effect at the
 10 percent level only.The last panel looks at the number of days children
 are reported to be working in agriculture.
 As in the case of male members, there is no correlation with fertility
 for the OLS specification in model (1).
 Full results are again reported in the appendix (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Effect-appchildren"

\end_inset

).
 There also seems to be no difference between rural and urban areas.
 However, female headed households are associated with lower levels of child
 labor.
 There is also weak evidence that a school and a health center in the community
 reduce child labour.
 Children work on average about 7 days on the field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When we instrument the fertility gap by the sex of the first-born, the coefficie
nt remains negative.
 This is different from what we find for days worked by the mother or the
 father.
 This would mean that a lower fertility reduces the time worked by children
 on the field.
 However, the coefficient becomes only significantly at a p-value of 0.162
 for the Anderson-Rubin test.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These findings are similar to what others have found.
 For instance, in their study on labour supply response to fertility in
 the United States, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:aea:aecrev:v:88:y:1998:i:3:p:450-77"

 in response to more children.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 in both rural and urban areas in Indonesia.

Table

 Again, the results reported in table

 only show the coefficients on the fertility gap.
 Full results are in the appendix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Model (1) in the top panel presents OLS results for number of days reported
 to be spending on land preparation.
 On average, the household spends about 38 days preparing land (table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:prepappe"

\end_inset

).
 There are no fertility effects.
 Again, as expected, households residing in urban areas spend significantly
 less time preparing land.
 Female headed households also allocate less time to land preparation.
 There is also some indication that women that have tertiary education are
 less engaged in land preparation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Model (2) presents the same model, but instruments fertility with the indicator
 for the first child being a girl.
 The fertility effect now becomes positive, but is not siginificantly different
 from zero.
 In model (3), where we look at the sex of the first two children, the fertility
 gap effect becomes significant.
 The effect remains significant when we instrument the fertility shortfall
 by the percentage of females born (model (4)) and in the over-identified
 model (5), but the effect size reduces.
 An additional child reduces time allocated to land preparation by about
 25 days.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second panel repeats the same five models, but uses days spent on input
 application as the dependent variable.
 In none of the five specifications, fertility seems to have a significant
 impact.
 Overall, time spend on input application is very limited anyway, as can
 be seen in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Average-hours-worked"

\end_inset

.
 In all, households spend only about one day applying inputs (including
 planting).
 The only significant effect we find is that households where the mother
 has at least primary education allocate more time to input application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The third panel presents results for time spend on weeding.
 The results are similar to the ones for land preparation, but the effects
 are smaller.
 Households spend on average 30 days weeding and each extra child reduces
 this by about 20 days.
 Full results in the appendix (table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:timeweeding"

\end_inset

) show significant negative effects for female headed households and for
 households in urban areas.
 We also find that communities that have a health center are spending less
 days on weeding.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the last panel looks at the effects of fertility on days worked
 for harvesting.
 There is no significant positive association between the number of children
 in the family and the number of days spend harvesting.
 The average number of days is about 26 days, lower than time allocated
 to both preparing the land and weeding.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above suggests that fertility affects time allocated to land preparation
 and weeding in a negative way.
 Harvesting seems to be less related to family size.
 Probably, when crops are ready to be harvested, farmers are more likely
 to put in the extra effort.
 This seems to be less evident for work that has an uncertain payoff in
 the future.
 The reductions of time allocated to land preparation and weeding may reduce
 both area planted and agricultural productivity.
 We will turn to this in the next section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Area planted, Production and Productivity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will now look at the effect of fertility on production and productivity.
 We will look at productivity defined as kilograms harvested per acre of

 We will also look the value of total production, the value of production

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 reports on the second stage regression of different aspects of production
 for the five most important crops.
 The table only reports the result coefficient on our fertility variable
 for the instrumental variable regression that uses the share of girls as
 excluded instrument.
 The regressions include the same control variables as in the previous sections.
 However, we now also added regional dummies, as some crops are grown more
 in some regions than in others.
 If the dependent variable is binary or censored, a tobit or probit is estimated
 using the methods described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "RePEc:eee:econom:v:36:y:1987:i:3:p:231-250"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first row takes as the outcome variable a dummy that is one if the household
 reported growing the crop and zero otherwise.
 We therefore estimated probit models that show us if additional children
 increase or decrease the likelihood that the household reports growing
 a certain crop.
 We find no significant effects for most crops.
 Only for sweet potatoes and for matooke it seems that a larger fertility
 gap increases the chance of growing the crop.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next row looks at the total area reported to be used to grow each crop,
 measured in acres.
 We find a positive effect of the fertility gap on the area used to grow
 matooke.
 The next row looks at the area as a share of total area.
 In this case, it seems that households with more children allocate less
 land as a share of total land to sweet potatoes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next row looks at the value of total production in kg.
 Only for matooke, again larger households seem to obtain a significantly
 lower quantity of matooke.
 The next row looks at production per capita.
 The lower production of matooke persists if we account for household size.
 Finally, for none of the products, the fertility gap has a significant
 effect on yield.In table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:2SLS-totals"

\end_inset

 we present results on total production and productivity, using the prices
 for the different crops as described in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 We present again five different models.
 The first one a regression that does not take endogeneity into account.
 While in the previous regressions this was typically OLS, this may now
 change to a probit or tobit regression, depending on the nature of the
 dependent variable.
 The second regression instruments the fertility gap with the sex of the
 firstborn.
 The third model uses the sex of the first two children born to the mother
 and the fourth uses the share of women amongst the children.
 As before, the fourth model instruments the fertility difference by two
 instruments: the sex of the firstborn and the share of girls among the
 children.
 If the dependent variable is binary or censored, a tobit or probit is estimated
 using the methods described in

\begin_layout Standard
The first row gives results for the change in production.
 There seems to be no detectable effect from fertility on the total value
 of the production of the five crops.
 The second row expresses this production in per capita terms.
 The OLS estimates show a positive effect of an increase in the fertility
 gap.
 However, if we confine to the exogenous part of fertility in the IV regressions
, the effect disappears.
 The next row looks at a change in the total area allocated to the five
 crops.
 There is again no significant effect from fertility.
 The final row, which looks at productivity defined as the total value of
 the five crops divided by the total area allocated to these five crops,
 also finds no causal impact from family size.

\begin_layout Section*
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we look at the effect of fertility, defined as the number
 of biological children born to the mother, on agricultural production and
 its determinants.
 One of the most evident determinants is household agricultural labour.
 More children means more labour is available within the household.
 However, more children also means that time of the most productive persons
 within the family farm, adult females, is lost to reproductive chores.
 In this paper, we try to isolate the causal effect of extra children on
 household labour supply and production.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The identification strategy we use relies on the premise that, in partilineal
 societies, boys are preferred to girls in terms of offspring.
 Households that have a girl as the first child will have a higher propensity
 to add more children to the household.
 The fact that the sex of the first child is exogenous can be used to identify
 the causal impact of additional children on other variables such as labour
 supply and productivity.
 Similarly, the fertility rule whereby one is more likely to stop having
 children after a boy means that, on average, larger households consist
 of more girls.
 Therefore, the share of females in the total number of children.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our first stage regression performs reasonably well.
 We find a significant negative effect of an indicator variable that the
 first-born is a girl on a variable that measures the shortfall from fecundity.
 We equally find a negative effect of an indicator that the first two children
 are female.
 Finally, we also find that households with a relatively higher share of
 girls are negatively related to the fertility gap.
 While our instruments are significant and have the correct sign, explanatory
 power as measured by the partial R-squared is low.
 We therefore use inference methods in the second stage that are robust
 to weak instruments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the second stage regression, we find that fertility affects both time
 women and men allocated to agricultural production.
 However, most of the labour time lost as a consequence of an exogenous
 increase in children is born by the woman.
 Especially land preparation and weeding are activities that seem to be
 reduced as a response to more children.
 When we look at crops, we find that only matooke and sweet potatoes are
 significantly affected by fertility.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Matooke is the most important stable crop in Uganda, providing 18 percent
 of caloric intake 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "RePEc:ags:midcwp:58553"

\end_inset

.
 The finding that young households that have higher fertility are reducing
 the most important source of calories suggests that higher fertility also
 causes under-nutrition.
 Sweet potatoes is also a typical food security crop, with a low return
 but also low risk 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "RePEc:ucp:ecdecc:v:44:y:1996:i:3:p:485-513"

\end_inset

.
 It is also a crop that is mostly under the control of the woman, who does
 much of the work on the field.
 Taken together, our analysis suggests fertility to be a serious threat
 to food security for these households.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That said, the fact that we rely on a cross-section of households also limits
 to what extent our conclusions can be generalized.
 It may well be that households that are at a later stage in their life
 cycle profit much more from larger household size.
 For instance, in households where the mother has reduced fertility, she
 may have more time to work in agricultural activities.
 In addition, children are likely to be older and much more productive in
 agriculture.
 Therefore, we want to stress that our results only hold for the subset
 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

young
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 households, where the women is between 16 and 32.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are different ways in which the negative effect of fertility on labour
 and production can be influenced.
 First, our analysis reconfirms the need for fertility reducing policies.
 Apart from known fertility reducing policies such as women education and
 improved maternal health care, the most promising policies would try to
 work on the root cause of increased fertility.
 This should be done by reducing the propensity of households to have higher
 fertility if the firstborn is a girl.
 We think of a host of policies that go against the patrilineal nature of
 these societies.
 For example, Uganda may consider changing its land act similar to what
 Kenya recently did and give equal inheritance rights to both girls and
 boys.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above policy response involves addressing cultural issues related to
 high fertility, some of which may face considerable resistance.
 Changing a set of cultural values is likely to be a very slow process.
 Meanwhile, the government of Uganda should support the nutritional needs
 of young families.
 It should also consider introducing agricultural technologies that save
 on agricultural labour, especially for women.
